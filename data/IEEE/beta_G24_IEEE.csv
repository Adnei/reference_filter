In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, achieving effective network slicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges, particularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the fast-changing network topology. By leveraging the widely deployed LTE infrastructures, we propose a semi-decentralized network slicing framework in this paper based on the C-V2X Mode-4 standard to provide customized network slices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial information of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying network situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each slice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB, each vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is realized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is a convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared to the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior knowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks.

Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents.

In this paper, we propose AZTEC, a data-driven framework that effectively allocates capacity to individual slices by adopting an original multi-timescale forecasting model. Hinging on a combination of Deep Learning architectures and a traditional optimization algorithm, AZTEC anticipates resource assignments that minimize the comprehensive management costs induced by resource overprovisioning, instantiation and reconfiguration, as well as by denied traffic demands.

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under dynamic traffic load, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by numerous variables. In this article, we investigate the reconfiguration within a core network slice with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This problem is also intractable by using conventional Deep Q Network (DQN), as it has a multi-dimensional discrete action space which is difficult to explore efficiently. To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose to exploit Branching Dueling Q-network which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. Based on the discrete BDQ network, we develop an intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm (INSRA). Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of INSRA and the numerical results reveal that INSRA can minimize the long-term resource consumption and achieve high resource efficiency compared with several benchmark algorithms.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3019248","Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871099,61631004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177109","Network slice reconfiguration;deep reinforcement learning;core network slicing;branch dueling q-network","Network slicing;Uncertainty;Resource management;Optimization;Machine learning;Substrates;Numerical models","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;connectivity services;performance isolation;network resource utilization;dynamic traffic load;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;high computational complexity;long-term resource consumption;deep Q network;multidimensional discrete action space;discrete BDQ network;intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm;high resource efficiency;branching dueling Q-network;action branching architecture;INSRA","","5","","44","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a new dynamic edge/fog network slicing scheme (EFNS) in which tenants can temporarily lease back to the Infrastructure Provider (InP) unused resources to serve demands exceeding its current resources in stock. To efficiently use the resources, tenants can also lease their subscribers' terminals when idle to act as fog nodes augmenting the infrastructure and service capability of the InP. Our goal is to find an optimal slice request admission policy, which includes slices with augmented resources, to maximize the long-term revenue of the InP. A semi-Markov decision process is used to model the arrival of slice requests by taking into account the dynamics of users' demands and availability of resources. To find the optimal policy under uncertain resource demands, a Q-learning (Q-EFNS) algorithm is developed. Additionally, to improve the convergence time and reduce the computational complexity of Q-learning in large-scale scenarios, a Deep reinforcement learning (DQ-EFNS) algorithm and an enhancement based on a Deep Dueling (Dueling DQ-EFNS) algorithm are presented. Finally, simulation results show improvements in the range between 20% to 60% by our algorithms compared to conventional fixed network slicing when only 8% of the subscribers act as fog nodes. Besides, by using Dueling DQ-EFNS, the optimal slice request admission policy is obtained in just a few iterations.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322631","Dynamic resource allocation;edge/fog network slicing;deep Q-learning;dueling DQN","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Uncertainty","6G mobile communication;computer network management;deep learning (artificial intelligence);distributed processing;Markov processes;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","future 6G wireless networks;storage resources;semiMarkov decision process;optimal policy;dynamic edge network slicing;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;dynamic fog network slicing;computing resources;radio resources;infrastructure provider;unused resources lease back;subscriber terminals leasing;long-term revenue;Q-learning algorithm;DQ-EFNS algorithm;deep dueling algorithm;InP","","","","12","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource reservation and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous virtual resource slicing framework for the next generation radio access network. The infrastructure provider periodically reserves the unused resource to the virtual networks based on their ratio of minimum resource requirements. Then, the virtual networks autonomously control their resource amount using deep reinforcement learning based on the average quality of service utility and resource utilization of users.

Specifically, we first introduce a novel system model which allows the network provider to effectively allocate its combinatorial resources, i.e., spectrum, computing, and storage, to various classes of users. To allocate resources to users while taking into account the dynamic demands of users and resources constraints of the network provider, we employ a semi-Markov decision process framework. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy for the network provider without requiring environment parameters, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is adopted. Although this algorithm can maximize the revenue of the network provider, its convergence to the optimal policy is particularly slow, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach using an advanced deep Q-learning technique, called deep dueling that can achieve the optimal policy at few thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can improve the long-term average return of the network provider up to 40% compared with other current approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761907","","Network slicing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;resource allocation","real-time network slicing;resource slicing solution;semiMarkov decision process framework;uncertain demand;time network slicing;advanced deep Q-learning technique;optimal policy;optimal resource allocation policy;combinatorial resources;uncertain customer demands;network resources;real-time dynamics;deep learning approach","","2","","18","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic control is applied using deep reinforcement learning that can learn optimal control by repeating trial and error. In this paper, we propose a method to allocate radio resources that satisfy the service requirements regardless of the number of slices using deep reinforcement learning. The proposed method flexibly controls multiple slices by observing the state of one slice and calling a model that controls one slice multiple times.

The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","1","","34","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Secondly, considering the imbalance of wireless resource utilization caused by the space-time difference between application scenarios, a shared proportional fairness scheme is proposed to achieve efficient and differentiated utilization of wireless resources. Finally, on the basis of ensuring the demand of each slice, the resource allocation algorithm based on the primal-dual interior-point method is used to solve the optimal slice weight allocation to minimize the system delay.

The impact of delay constraints may lead to rejection of demands, resulting in low resource utilization of network resources. This is especially severe when dynamic traffic is considered. Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios.

By leveraging SDN and NVF techniques, it enables the coexistence of several heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs) on top of the same physical infrastructure. Despite the advantages it brings to network operators, network slicing raises a major challenge: Resource allocation of VNs, also known as the virtual network embedding problem (VNEP). VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper, we investigate network slice reconfiguration with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address the curse of dimensionality of the problem, we propose to incorporate the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) into DRL, to avoid some unnecessary calculations of Q-value by separating the Q-network into a shared value branch and a number of distributed advantage branches. Furthermore, the value branch and the advantage branch of each dimension are aggregated to derive the corresponding dimension's sub-Q-value.

This algorithm jointly considers the radio access network slices and core network slices to dynamically allocate resources to maximize the number of access users. First we build such a model, which is a mixed integer programming problem and it needs to be dynamically adjusted according to the changes of environment. We propose to use DQN algorithm to solve this problem, which can perceive changes in the environment and make dynamic decisions. Under each decision, we need to calculate the reward value of DQN, so we divide the problem into the core side and the access side. Then the dynamic knapsack algorithm and the link mapping algorithm are used to obtain the reward. The simulation results show that the average access rate of DQN scheme is higher than 97%. Compared with the optimal allocation scheme of access side, the average access rate is increased by 9% for delay constrained slices and 5% for rate constrained slices in a dynamic environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006502","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871237); Program to Cultivate Middle-aged and Young Science Leaders of Universities of Jiangsu Province and the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BE2019017); Project of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY217028,NY215100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9131779","5G network;network slicing;resource allocation;deep Q-networks","Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Resource management;Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Reliability","5G mobile communication;decision making;integer programming;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","radio access network slices;core network slices;mixed integer programming problem;DQN algorithm;dynamic knapsack algorithm;link mapping algorithm;average access rate;delay constrained slices;rate constrained slices;dynamic environment;deep Q-learning;optimal allocation scheme;dynamic decision making;E2E network slicing resource allocation algorithm;network slicing;5G network;Deep Q-Networks;end-to-end network slicing resource allocation algorithm;fifth-generation communication system","","6","","24","CCBY","2 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To mitigate the increasing complexity of network slicing in 5G, we propose to leverage the recent advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies for automated network operation. Specifically, we propose intelligent network slicing architecture for V2X services, where network functions and multi-dimensional network resources are virtualized and assigned to different network slices.

In this paper, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing method that flexibly allocates RAN resources using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In RANs, the number of slices controlled by a base station fluctuates in terms of user ingress and egress from the base station coverage area and service switching on the respective sets of user equipment. Therefore, when resource allocation depends on the number of slices, resources cannot be allocated when the number of slices changes. We consider a method that makes optimal-resource allocation independent of the number of slices. Resource allocation is optimized using DRL, which learns the best action for a state through trial and error. To achieve independence from the number of slices, we show a design for a model that manages resources on a one-slice-by-one-agent basis using Ape-X, which is a DRL method. In Ape-X, because agents can be employed in parallel, models that learn various environments can be generated through trial and error of multiple environments. In addition, we design a model that satisfies the slicing requirements without over-allocating resources. Based on this design, it is possible to optimally allocate resources independently of the number of slices by changing the number of agents. In the evaluation, we test multiple scenarios and show that the mean satisfaction of the slice requirements is approximately 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986050","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057705","Deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;RAN slicing;resource management","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Machine learning;Scalability;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication switching","flexible resource block allocation;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing method;RAN resources;optimal-resource allocation;one-slice-by-one-agent basis;fifth-generation mobile communications;RAN slicing method;Ape-X","","7","","34","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Future access points (APs) are expected to have self-organizational capabilities, able to deal with large configuration spaces in order to dynamically configure each slice. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge. Enhanced with an off-line learning step, the proposed approach is able to achieve the optimal slice configuration with a fast convergence, which is attractive for dynamic scenarios.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","10.1109/INFCOMW.2019.8845211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845211","network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;Wi-Fi networks","Wireless fidelity;Network slicing;Artificial neural networks;Optimization;Convergence;Reinforcement learning;Knowledge engineering","learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;wireless LAN","dynamic network slicing;IEEE 802.11 networks;multiple logical networks;unplanned Wi-Fi networks;off-line learning step;deep reinforcement learning;wireless networks;fast-learning DRL model","","6","","20","","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several baselines in terms of throughput and delay with low complexity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2900234","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374189,61620106011,61601097); Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile MCM(grant numbers:20160304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z011); Zhongshan City Project(grant numbers:180809162197874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644035","V-FRAN;Network Slicing;Cross Entropy;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Interference;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","entropy;Internet of Things;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;tree searching;vehicular ad hoc networks","resource allocation;slice scheduling algorithm;collaborative scheduling scheme;road traffic speed;release available IoV resource;heavy traffic load;modern transportation systems;intense information exchange;heterogeneous network traffic;complicated network environment;dynamic vehicle density;fog-radio access network;network slicing;maldistributed network traffic;available fog resources;weak resource utilization;smart slice scheduling scheme;vehicular fog radio access networks;network slices;smart network slicing;vehicular fog-RAN;Internet of Vehicles;Markov decision process;Monte Carlo tree search;metric cross entropy","","23","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by the definition and standardization of mobile networks, especially 5G that focused on business verticals, the term network slicing has received numerous state-of-the-art efforts to materialize an approach that meets dynamism, programmability, and flexibility requirements. Leveraged by SDN and NFV technologies, network slicing is inspiring by resource sharing similar to virtual machine management, allowing standard network hardware to accommodate a wide variety of logical networks with specific requirements and data and control planes. However, state-of-the-art approaches do not address resource slicing at the core of the network in detail and appropriately. Therefore, we built NASOR to provide network slicing over the Internet data plane spanning across multiple domains through a segment routing and a distributed-based approach. Our approach excels those found in state-of-the-art by delivering an open policy interface that allows third-party applications to manage network slices dynamically. In this sense, this paper exploits this interface through a mechanism of convolutional neural networks that classifies network traffic, instructing the path-setting agent to be aware of application which predominantly runs on the network improving dynamism in the network slices deployment. Experiments showcase the convolutional neural network applicability and suitability as an enabling technology to enhance and instruct NASOR to establish network slices over multiple domains.","1976-7684","978-1-7281-9101-0","10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333872","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333872","SDN;NFV;Segment Routing;Network Sllicing;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks","Network slicing;Telecommunication traffic;Routing;Virtual machining;Convolutional neural networks;Resource management;Standards","5G mobile communication;computer network management;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","path-setting agent;third-party applications;open policy interface;segment routing;Internet data plane;NASOR;control plane;resource sharing;SDN technology;NFV technology;5G networks;deep learning;network slice establishment;dynamism improvement;network slicing;mobile networks;convolutional neural network applicability;network slices deployment;network traffic;resource slicing;logical networks;standard network hardware","","","","32","","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computationally-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (5GAuRA)(grant numbers:675806); Secretaria d’Universitats i Recerca del Departament d’Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2017 SGR 376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","19","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are two of the key enabler technologies in 5G networks that can be used to optimize the allocation of the network resources and guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications. As traditional model-based optimization techniques generally end up with NP-hard and strongly non-convex and nonlinear mathematical programming formulations, in this article, we introduce a model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the resource allocation problem in MEC-enabled IoV networks based on network slicing. Furthermore, the solution uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable better exploitation of the scarce channel resources. The considered problem addresses jointly the channel and power allocation, the slice selection, and the vehicle selection (vehicle grouping). We model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then we solve it using DRL with the well-known deep Q learning (DQL) algorithm.

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios.

Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Q-th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds. These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy.

In this paper, we investigate the realization approach of fog RAN slicing, where two network slice instances for hotspot and vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios are concerned and orchestrated. In particular, the framework for RAN slicing is formulated as an optimization problem of jointly tackling content caching and mode selection, in which the time-varying channel and unknown content popularity distribution are characterized. Due to the different users' demands and the limited resources, the complexity of original optimization problem is significant high, which makes traditional optimization approaches hard to be directly applied. To deal with this dilemma, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, whose core idea is that the cloud server makes proper decisions on the content caching and mode selection to maximize the reward performance under the dynamical channel state and cache status.

Legacy models that aim at forecasting traffic demands fail to capture these key economic aspects of network operation. To close this gap, we present DeepCog, a deep neural network architecture inspired by advances in image processing and trained via a dedicated loss function.

However, effective slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) is very challenging due to the diverse QoS requirements and dynamic conditions in the 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;quality of service;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling","model-based control;transfer learning;radio resource allocation;adaptive control strategy;heterogeneous quality of service;5th generation-beyond networks;next generation NodeB-level slicing;autonomic RAN slicing control;self-learning RAN slicing control;network slice;gNodeB-level;packet scheduling level slicing;network-level slicing;network conditions;slicing control performance;network resources;QoS requirements;radio access network;6G networks;5G networks;service provisioning;intelligent self-sustained RAN slicing framework","","2","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Each communication request comes with quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward can be measured by the weight (priority) of this request. The accumulated reward over time should be maximized by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds a request generation algorithm through reinforcement learning that decides on how to craft fake requests to maximize the reward of fake requests over time, which in turn minimizes the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is more effective than other benchmark attacks such as generating random fake requests and fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement). Finally, we evaluate how the attack performance depends on system parameters such as the weight and the generation rate of fake requests, and the channel condition. Our results show that the flooding attack poses a major threat for network slicing in terms of starving 5G RAN resources and denying service to real network slicing requests.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473567","U.S. Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473567","","Weight measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Throughput;Quality of experience","","","","","","43","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","28","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is challenging. In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform.

In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party. Numerical results show that the proposed HDRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and communication efficiency in comparison with some state-of-the-art solutions.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3033035","Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9237167","RAN slicing;device association;federated learning;deep reinforcement learning","Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Data security;Data privacy;Optimization;Access control","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","BS-encrypted party;data security;handoff management;5G-and-beyond systems;device association scheme;access control;layer association relationship;key architectural technology;hybrid federated deep reinforcement learning;communication efficiency;network throughput;hybrid FL framework;data privacy;smart devices;hybrid FL reinforcement learning framework;RAN slicing;mobile networks;data protection;distributed learning paradigm;device association problem;local resources;device privacy","","5","","46","IEEE","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network slicing unfolds a new market dimension to the infrastructure providers as well as to the tenants, who may acquire a network slice from the infrastructure provider to deliver a specific service to their respective subscribers. In this new context, there is a growing need for new network resource allocation algorithms to capture such proposition. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a family of online algorithms with the aim to (i) minimize tenants spectrum allocation costs, (ii) maximize radio resource utilization and (iii) ensure that the service level agreements (SLAs) provided to tenants are satisfied. We focus on improving the performance of prediction-based decisions that are made by a tenant when prediction models lack the desired accuracy.

Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture for multiple operators and cloud providers, with a new proof of business consensus protocol to ensure incentive and fairness.

In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks.

The different slices' tenants (i.e. logical operators) are dynamically allocated isolated portions of physical resource blocks (PRBs), baseband processing resources, backhaul capacity as well as data forwarding elements (DFE) and SDN controller connections. By invoking massive key performance indicators (KPIs) datasets stemming from a live cellular network endowed with traffic probes, we first introduce a low-complexity slices' traffics predictor based on a soft gated recurrent unit (GRU). We then build-at each virtual network function-joint multi-slice deep neural networks (DNNs) and train them to estimate the required resources based on the traffic per slice, while not violating two service level agreement (SLA), namely, violation rate-based SLA and resource bounds-based SLA. This is achieved by integrating dataset-dependent generalized non-convex constraints into the DNN offline optimization tasks that are solved via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. In this respect, we highlight the role of the underlying hyperparameters in the trade-off between overprovisioning and slices' isolation. Finally, using reliability theory, we provide a closed-form analysis for the lower bound of the so-called reliable convergence probability and showcase the effect of the violation rate on it.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2959186","research projects AGAUR(grant numbers:2017-SGR-891); SPOT5G(grant numbers:TEC2017-87456-P); 5G-SOLUTIONS(grant numbers:856691); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931583","5G;deep neural networks;dynamic slicing;non-convex optimization;reliability theory;SDN/NFV;SLA;violation rate","Logic gates;Neural networks;5G mobile communication;Deep learning;Resource management;Reliability theory;Virtualization","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;probability;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","live cellular network;low-complexity slices;virtual network function;violation rate-based SLA;bounds-based SLA;5G networks;dynamic end-to-end slicing;resource provisioning;physical resource blocks;baseband processing resources;massive key performance indicators datasets;offline SLA-constrained deep learning;software defined networking;network function virtualization;fifth generation networks;data forwarding elements;SDN controller connections;gated recurrent unit;multislice deep neural networks;service level agreement;DNN offline optimization tasks;nonzero sum two-player game","","8","","24","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another challenge is the combinatorial optimization of numerous resources, e.g., radio, computing, and storage. This paper develops an optimal and fast real-time resource slicing framework that maximizes the long-term return of the network provider while taking into account the uncertainty of resource demands from tenants. Specifically, we first propose a novel system model that enables the network provider to effectively slice various types of resources to different classes of users under separate virtual slices. We then capture the real-time arrival of slice requests by a semi-Markov decision process. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy under the dynamics of slicing requests, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is often adopted in the literature. However, such an algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. This makes Q-learning practically inapplicable to our case, in which multiple resources are simultaneously optimized. To tackle it, we propose a novel network slicing approach with an advanced deep learning architecture, called deep dueling, that attains the optimal average reward much faster than the conventional Q-learning algorithm. This property is especially desirable to cope with the real-time resource requests and the dynamic demands of the users. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework yields up to 40% higher long-term average return while being few thousand times faster, compared with the state-of-the-art network slicing approaches.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666109","Network slicing;MDP;Q-learning;deep reinforcement learning;deep dueling;resource allocation","Network slicing;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;optimisation;resource allocation;virtualisation","deep dueling neural networks;network resource requests;combinatorial optimization;resource demands;semiMarkov decision process;optimal resource allocation policy;uncertain service time;optimal average reward;real-time resource requests;network provider;virtual slices;Q-learning algorithm;optimal resource slicing framework;network slicing approach;deep learning architecture","","27","","49","IEEE","12 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This chapter identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal‐level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.","","9781119723912","10.1002/9781119723950.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9536303.pdf&bkn=9536219&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Training data;Sensors","","","","","","","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Moreover, software defined network (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) empower this architecture to visualize the physical network resources. The network slicing identified as a multiple logical network, where each network slice dedicates as an end-to-end network and works independently with other slices on a common physical network resources. Most user devices have more than one smart wireless interfaces to connect to different radio access technologies (RATs) such as WiFi and LTE, thereby network operators utilize this facility to offload mobile data traffic. Therefore, it is important to enable a network slicing to manage different RATs on the same logical network as a way to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem and enables a slice to control its users' mobility across different access networks. In this paper, we propose a mobility management architecture based network slicing where each slice manages its users across heterogeneous radio access technologies such as WiFi, LTE and 5G networks. In this architecture, each slice has a different mobility demands and these demands are governed by a network slice configuration and service characteristics. Therefore, our mobility management architecture follows a modular approach where each slice has individual module to handle the mobility demands and enforce the slice policy for mobility management. The advantages of applying our proposed architecture include: i) Sharing network resources between different network slices; ii) creating logical platform to unify different RATs resources and allowing all slices to share them; iii) satisfying slice mobility demands.","","978-1-5386-5395-1","10.1109/WAINA.2018.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418082","5G Network;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution (LTE);WiFi;Software Defined Networking (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Mobility Management;IP Flow;Data offloading","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Computer architecture;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","mobility management architecture;efficient network connectivity;software defined network;multiple logical network;network slice dedicates;end-to-end network;common physical network resources;network operators;network slice configuration;service characteristics;RAT based network slicing;spectrum scarcity problem mitigation;heterogeneous radio access technologies","","3","","12","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network virtualization coupled with function virtualization enables network providers to offer on‐demand virtualized networks and services. Network slicing goes a step further by facilitating a new business model, namely Network‐as‐a‐Service, to offer dedicated and customized network slices (i.e. partitions of physical infrastructure) to multiple tenants, while ensuring proper isolation. However, this shift introduces new challenges for network providers and calls for intelligent and automated management. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered as enablers for the automated deployment and management of virtualized networks and services. This chapter exposes the state‐of‐the‐art research that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to address complex problems in deploying and managing virtualized networks and services.

The ability to provide virtual, logically independent “slices” of the network will also have an impact on the models that will sustain the business ecosystem. Network slicing will open the door to new players: the infrastructure provider, which is the owner of the infrastructure, and the tenants, which may acquire a network slice from the infrastructure provider to deliver a specific service to their customers. In this new context, how to correctly handle resource allocation among tenants and how to maximize the monetization of the infrastructure become fundamental problems that need to be solved. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a network slice admission control algorithm that (i) autonomously learns the best acceptance policy while (ii) it ensures that the service guarantees provided to tenants are always satisfied. The contributions of this paper include: (i) an analytical model for the admissibility region of a network slicing-capable 5G Network, (ii) the analysis of the system (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and the optimization of the infrastructure providers revenue, and (iii) the design of a machine learning algorithm that can be deployed in practical settings and achieves close to optimal performance.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2896950","H2020 5G-MoNArch project(grant numbers:761445); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(grant numbers:TEC2016-76795-C6-3-R); 5G-Transformer project(grant numbers:761536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632676","Network slicing;admission control;neural networks;machine learning;5G networks","5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Machine learning;Admission control;Biological system modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management","network slice admission control algorithm;infrastructure providers revenue;machine learning algorithm;future 5G Networks;logically independent slices;network slicing;semi-Markov decision process","","20","","48","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As machine learning (ML) is expected to play a pivotal role in the efficient control and management of these networks, in this work, we examine the ML-based quality-of-transmission (QoT) estimation problem under the dynamic network slicing context, where each slice has to meet a different QoT requirement. Specifically, we examine ML-based QoT frameworks with the aim of finding QoT model/s that are fine-tuned according to the diverse QoT requirements. Centralized and distributed frameworks are examined and compared according to their model accuracy, routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) accuracy, and CPU (training time) and RAM (memory) requirements. We show that the distributed QoT models outperform the centralized QoT model in accuracy and CPU usage. The RSA accuracy, i.e., measuring the accuracy of the models with regard to the QoT-aware RSA decisions, is sufficiently high for both frameworks. Regarding the RAM usage, as the distributed framework has to train in parallel several QoT models, it may require higher memory, especially as the number of diverse QoT requirements increases. This memory, however, tends to be reserved for a shorter period of time. Moreover, this work develops a dynamic multi-slice QoT-aware (RSA) framework that integrates the ML-based QoT models. The aim is to examine the network performance when the diverse QoT models are considered, as opposed to the state-of-the-art single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach where all connections/slices are provisioned according to a single QoT requirement. We show that the multi-slice QoT-aware RSA approach significantly improves network performance, a clear indicator that the commonly considered single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach may lead to connection overprovisioning.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.387853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067831","","Estimation;Network slicing;Optical fiber networks;Solid modeling;Training;Random access memory","learning (artificial intelligence);optical fibre networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","decentralizing machine-learning-based QoT estimation;sliceable optical networks;machine learning;ML-based quality-of-transmission estimation problem;dynamic network slicing context;ML-based QoT frameworks;distributed frameworks;model accuracy;RAM requirements;distributed QoT models;centralized QoT model;RSA accuracy;QoT-aware RSA decisions;distributed framework;parallel several QoT models;multislice QoT-aware framework;ML-based QoT models;network performance;diverse QoT models;single QoT requirement;multislice QoT-aware RSA;single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach;diverse QoT requirements;5G diverse use cases","","3","","","","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, simply utilizing network slicing and MEC is insufficient when providing a specific IoT service. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of arranging and operating common service functions (CSFs) used in the IoT platform at the edge of the network. In addition, it is necessary not only to deliver virtual CSFs but also to implement autoscaling policies of these virtual common service resources. This study extends the idea of resource slicing technologies for the IoT service layer. The IoT service layer exposes the virtual IoT CSFs as an IoT slice service to be provided in the form of virtual network functions (VNFs) with MEC applications on top of the network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) at the edge of the network.

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience. To validate our approach, we evaluate the agent under different configurations and in real-world settings and present the results.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3074618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409935","5G and beyond;Service Function Chain;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Multi-access Edge Computing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Management and Orchestration.","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Channel allocation;Servers;Resource management","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. We then evaluate each class of algorithms in terms of accuracy, sample complexity, and model explainability. Our experiments reveal that, in terms of these three requirements, the gradient boosting and neural network algorithms for SLA decomposition out-perform random forest algorithms, given emulated data sets.","","978-1-7281-5684-2","10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165317","Network slicing;E2E orchestration;SLA;random forest;gradient boosting;neural networks","Machine learning;Network slicing;Data models;Training;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Quality of service","augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;random forests;supervised learning","mobile networks;core networks;total SLA budget;network service operators;SLA decomposition planner;network slicing;supervised machine learning algorithms;neural network algorithms;end-to-end slice SLA decomposition;network service industry;industrial automation;augmented reality;virtual reality","","","","26","","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as nowadays networks are increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and large-dimensioned. This contradicts the dominant network slicing solutions that only customize immediate performance over one snapshot of the system in the literature. Instead, this paper first presents a two-stage slicing optimization model with time-averaged metrics to safeguard the network slicing in the dynamical networks, where prior environmental knowledge is absent but can be partially observed at runtime. Directly solving an off-line solution to this problem is intractable since the future system realizations are unknown before decisions. Therefore, we propose a learning augmented optimization approach with deep learning and Lyapunov stability theories. This enables the system to learn a safe slicing solution from both historical records and run-time observations. We prove that the proposed solution is always feasible and nearly optimal, up to a constant additive factor.

To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS).

Network slicing allows to offer programmable network instances, which match the requirements of the individual use cases, subscriber types, and applications. Within a slice, network functions and elements can be instantiated according to the specific service demands such as ultra-low latency, massive IoT, or dense broadband.

While this need for dynamic cross-CSP cooperation is widely recognized, realization of this need is not yet possible due to gaps both in business processes and in technical capabilities.In this paper, we present a 5GZORRO approach to dynamic cross-CSP slice scaling. Our approach both enables CSPs to collaborate, providing security and trust with smart multi-party contracts, and facilitates thus achieved collaboration to enable resource sharing across multiple administrative domains, either during slice establishment or when already existing slice needs to expand or shrink. Our approach allows automating both business and technical processes involved in dynamic lifecycle management of cross-CSP network slices, following ETSI’s Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) closed-loop architecture, and relying on resource-sharing Marketplace, Distributed Ledger (DL), and Operational Data Lake.

The new intelligent control for active and passive learning in the integrated semantic space works in a semantic space that is dynamically formed by the combinations of meaning space attained from the semantic associative calculation and the learned visual feature space derived by deep learning over the media data. Our model is inspired by the human ability to understand the semantic meaning of information by using active and passive learning. To get the query image results with similar semantic meaning, we define two types of knowledge representations: known and unknown semantic. Known semantic, is a set of the comprehensive concepts of meaning that is embedded in the system and used for the semantic associative calculation to construct the meaning space. We associate it with the passive learning. On the other hand, the unknown semantic knowledge is a set of comprehensive concepts of meaning that is not discovered in the system and has to be sought from the pattern of media through statistic and/or learned patterns. This deep active learning can be associated with the active human learning. We describe how the system chooses the subspace from the semantic space through the intelligent control for active and passive learning in the integrated semantic space by slicing, dicing and pivoting dimensions to identify and retrieve the meaning of images. The proposed system is an experimental modular model for database developed to answer the given semantic query in which the axis is represented in the columnar model database.

However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take the full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node, where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conducted an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides twice as much transmission speed as that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3052498","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Fast Intelligence Analysis HW/SW Engine Exploiting IoT Platform for Boosting On-device AI in 5G Environment)(grant numbers:2020-0-00959); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328448","Internet of Things (IoT);multiaccess edge computing (MEC);network slicing;oneM2M standard;virtualization","Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Network slicing;Computer architecture;Edge computing;5G mobile communication","","","","","","72","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In Beyond 5G (B5G) networks it is envisioned that slices should be created, deployed, and managed in an automated fashion (i.e., without human intervention) irrespective of the technological and administrative domains over which a slice may span. Achieving this vision requires a combination of novel physical layer technologies, artificial intelligence tools, standard interfaces, network function virtualization, and software-defined networking principles.

Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g., automotive, smart factories, e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in a cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel network slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted Blockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond traditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the Intermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to allocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and re-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable manner.

The physical layer of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) is the weakest layer in the network as anyone can access the optical cables from any location and states his attack. To overcome this thread a security layer is proposed to be added during the mapping processes of OTN frames. The automatic detection of any intrusion is done by monitoring the variations of the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) by using intelligent software-defined networks (SDN). For the first time the paper shows the role of the machine learning (ML) techniques in the multi-failure restorations of the optical transport network, and a new model is introduced by slicing the multi-domains to 3 layers to fit the needs of 5G at the same time all these domains are managed by only one centralized intelligent controller. The results show that using intelligent techniques such as artificial intelligence in the provisioning of optical transport network could improve the multi-failure restoration from 25% to 100%, the revenue from some OTN domains could be increased by 50%, the switching time could be enhanced by 50%, the latency could be reduced from 27 msec to 742 musec, and it will take many years to figure out the right keys to perform the decryption process from any intruder.","","978-1-7281-8226-1","10.1109/NILES50944.2020.9257917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9257917","Optical Transport Network (OTN);Optical to Signal Network Ratio (OSNR);wiretapping;Multi-Failure;Service restorations;machine learning technology;centralized controller;Signal Cryptographic","Adaptive optics;Optical fibers;Optical network units;Security;Cryptography;Optical polarization;Physical layer","client-server systems;computer network management;computer network reliability;computer network security;intelligent control;optical fibre networks;software defined networking;telecommunication control","smart security model;optical network;artificial intelligence;client signals;physical layer;optical transport network;weakest layer;optical cables;security layer;optical signal;intelligent software-defined networks;multifailure restoration;centralized intelligent controller","","","","23","","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses the service provider maximization revenue problem in network slicing, aiming at offering customized services for different users' classes and heterogeneous requirements. In particular, the slicing of the network is performed here on the basis of the end users' perspective, considered at different levels. The customers demand forecasting is pursuit for service classes through the application of the federated learning framework according to which the end users act as clients.

Mobile operators shall be able to serve all of these requirements using shared network infrastructure's resources. To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","5G mobile communication;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;quality of service;regression analysis;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics);virtualisation","knapsack problems;admission control;recursive optimization;regression trees;OAI;open air interface;network infrastructure resources;mobile operators;5G network slices;slicing decision;machine learning;static slicing;ML based approaches;5G experimental prototype;slice scheduler modules;resource pool;physical resources;optimum slice;network resources;dynamic slicing approach;physical network;logical virtual networks;shared network infrastructure;heterogeneous demands;resource orchestration;ML based approach;uninformed random slicing-decisions","","6","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, managing RAN resources and sharing them among network slices is an increasingly difficult task, which needs to be properly designed. The goal is to improve network performance and introduce flexibility and greater utilization of network resources by accurately and dynamically provisioning the activated network slices with the appropriate amounts of resources to meet their diverse requirements. In this paper, we propose a data-driven RAN slicing mechanism based on a resource sharing algorithm running at the Slice Orchestrator (SO) level. This algorithm computes the necessary radio resources to be used by each deployed network slice. These resources are adjusted periodically based on current estimates of achievable throughput performance derived from channel quality information, and in particular from the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values of the users of each network slice retrieved from the RAN. CQI information is reported to base stations by the User Equipment (UE) following standard procedures, but extracting and frequently reporting it from base stations to the SO may result in significant communication overhead. To mitigate this overhead while maintaining at the SO level an accurate view of UE channel qualities, we propose a machine learning approach to infer the stability of UE channel conditions, as well as predictive schemes to reduce the CQI reporting intensity based on the inferred channel status. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of our data-driven RAN slicing framework, which allows to meet the stringent requirements of two main classes of network slices in 5G, i.e., enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3098193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490293","Network slicing;radio resource sharing;RAN monitoring;CQI;machine learning.","Resource management;Monitoring;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Base stations;5G mobile communication;Channel estimation;Radio access networks","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This allows the network to support the diverse requirements of different IoT verticals ranging from connected vehicles to smart agriculture. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network slice assignment scheme for software-defined IoT networks, where each application type is assigned to a distinct slice controller depending on its QoS requirements. We formulate the optimal mapping between network slices and slice controllers as an integer programming problem, and show that the proposed scheme is capable of significantly reducing the number of QoS violations compared to existing controller mapping schemes. Further, we present a scheduling scheme to dynamically re-compute the optimal mapping, based on optimal stopping theory, while taking into consideration the temporal variations in traffic and link latencies.

A key feature of this architecture is the implementation of network slicing over a single infrastructure to provision highly heterogeneous vertical services, as well as a network slicing management system capable of handling simultaneous slices. On top of the network slicing technology, functionality needs to be devised to deploy the slices required by the different vertical players and provide them with a suitable interface to manage their slice.

However, the introduction of network slicing into radio access networks (RAN) can greatly increase user handover complexity in cellular networks. Specifically, both physical resource constraints on base stations (BSs) and logical connection constraints on network slices (NSs) should be considered when making a handover decision. Moreover, various service types call for an intelligent handover scheme to guarantee the diversified QoS requirements. As such, in this article, a multiagent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handover Scheme, named LESS, is proposed, with the purpose of minimizing handover cost while maintaining user QoS. Due to the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity caused by user mobility, conventional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot be applied directly. To solve these difficulties, LESS exploits the unique characteristics of slicing in designing two algorithms: 1) LESS-DL, a distributed Q-learning algorithm to make handover decisions with reduced action space but without compromising handover performance; 2) LESS-QVU, a modified Q-value update algorithm which exploits slice traffic similarity to improve the accuracy of Q-value evaluation with limited data. Thus, LESS uses LESS-DL to choose the target BS and NS when a handover occurs, while Q-values are updated by using LESS-QVU. The convergence of LESS is theoretically proved in this article. Simulation results show that LESS can significantly improve network performance. In more detail, the number of handovers, handover cost and outage probability are reduced by around 50%, 65%, and 45%, respectively, when compared with traditional methods.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3031079","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971099); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663476); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S02476X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223714","Handover;RAN slicing;multi-agent reinforcement learning;quality of service","Handover;Quality of service;Network slicing;Radio access networks;Cellular networks","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","cellular networks;handover decision;multiagent reinforcement learning;smart handover scheme;QoS;reinforcement learning algorithms;distributed Q-learning algorithm;modified Q-value update algorithm;handover mechanism;radio access network slicing;mobile networks;slice traffic","","3","","31","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distance representation is inspired by previous knowledge of the domain to increase the generalizability of the deep learning models for radiation treatment planning. Conventional knowledge-based planning methods extract engineered features from 3D CT-scan images, as well as other patients' features, to predict the best achievable dose in a cancerous area and other organs at risk. Recent studies have shown higher accuracy in voxel-level dose prediction using deep learning models compared to the conventional machine learning approaches. Since the data resources for training these models are limited, most of the studies use 2D contour information to represent the patient anatomy. This representation loses volumetric information, and it is sensitive to small changes in patient orientation and translation. The distance-based representation introduced in this paper is inspired by the domain knowledge and is able to maintain the volumetric distance information despite the 2D slicing of 3D CT-image. According to prior studies in the radiation treatment planning domain, there is a strong association between the organs-at-risk distance from the cancerous volume and the patient's vulnerability to receive excessive dose. Therefore, the contour value in prior representation was replaced by voxel distance from cancerous volume. This modification in representation makes it transition and orientation invariant and adds potential robustness to patient positioning differences during the imaging/planning process. We evaluated the distance-based deep learning models through experiments for prediction of prostate cancer patients' vulnerability and voxel-level dose distribution using convolutional neural network and U-net models, respectively. The results were compared with contour-based U-net model as well as conventional machine learning with engineered representations. We found that the performance was comparable or higher than the prior state-of-the-art results for prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction.","","978-1-7281-1867-3","10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983412","deep learning;knowledge-based planning;KBP;intensity-modulated radiation therapy;IMRT planning","","biological organs;cancer;computerised tomography;convolutional neural nets;dosimetry;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;radiation therapy","3D CT-scan images;voxel-level dose prediction;machine learning approaches;volumetric distance information;radiation treatment planning domain;organs-at-risk distance;cancerous volume;distance-based deep learning model;prostate cancer patients;U-net models;prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction;prostate radiation treatment;distance representation;conventional knowledge-based planning methods;imaging-planning process;convolutional neural network","","1","","19","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

V2X communication refers to the exchange of information between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I) or between vehicles (V2V). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for the next generation of connected devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Following this idea, we propose a network slicing based communication model for vehicular networks. In this paper, we have modelled a multi-lane highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic requirements. Autonomous driving slice (exchanges safety messages) and infotainment slice (provides video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. In addition, a relaying approach is utilized to improve the performance of low signal-to-interferenceplus- noise-ratio (SINR) video streaming vehicles. These low SINR vehicles are served by other infotainment vehicles, which have high quality V2V and V2I link and are not serving as autonomous driving slice access point.

Despite the undisputed benefits in terms of flexibility and scalability that are pledged by the paradigm, network slicing requires intelligent resource scheduling and allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources, especially at the edge of the network, due to their scarcity. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for steering data traffic of multiple slices in the edge backhaul network, which aims at maximizing the QoS.

Therefore, network slicing is included as a key feature of the 5G architecture to allow sharing a common infrastructure among different tenants, such as mobile communication providers, vertical market players, etc. In order to provide the Radio Access Network (RAN) with network slicing capabilities, mechanisms that efficiently distribute the available capacity among the different tenants while satisfying their needs are required. For this purpose, this paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for RAN capacity sharing. It makes use of the Deep Q-Network algorithm in a way that each agent is associated to a different tenant and learns the capacity to be provided to this tenant in each cell while ensuring that the service level agreements are satisfied and that the available radio resources are efficiently used. The consideration of multiple agents contributes to a better scalability and higher learning speed in comparison to single-agent approaches. In this respect, results show that the policy learnt by the agent of one tenant can be generalised and directly applied by other agents, thus reducing the complexity of the training and making the proposed solution easily scalable, e.g., to add new tenants in the system. The proposed approach is well aligned with the on-going 3GPP standardization work and guidelines for the parametrization of the solution are provided, thus enforcing its practical applicability.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3099557","Spanish Research Council and FEDER funds(grant numbers:TEC2017-82651-R); European Commission's Horizon 2020 5G-CLARITY(grant numbers:871428); Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge of the Government of Catalonia(grant numbers:2020FI_B2 00075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497684","RAN slicing;capacity sharing;multi-agent reinforcement learning;Deep Q-Network","Vehicular and wireless technologies","","","","","","38","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cavdar",NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Communications Magazine","10 Mar 2019","2019","57","3","42","48","Supporting ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is a major challenge of 5G wireless networks. Stringent delay and reliability requirements need to be satisfied for both scheduled and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to enable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and media access control layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy scheduled URLLC traffic, there is lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled URLLC traffic, especially in coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic. Machine learning (ML) is an important enabler to manage this coexistence scenario due to its ability to exploit spatial/ temporal correlation in user behaviors and use of radio resources. In this article, we first study the coexistence design challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM) problem, and propose a distributed risk- aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed solution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal radio resource slicing, and proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying the delay/reliability requirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to investigate the potential of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC traffic types. The results further provide insights on the benefits of leveraging intelligent RRM. For example, a 75 percent increase in data rate with respect to the conservative design approach for the scheduled traffic is achieved, while the 99.99 percent reliability of both scheduled and non-scheduled traffic types is satisfied.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663990","","Delays;Artificial intelligence;Resource management;Machine learning;Low latency communication;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;access protocols;quality of service;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","risk-aware resource allocation;machine learning;low-latency communications;5G wireless networks;reliability requirements;physical media access control layer solutions;enabling transmission;nonscheduled URLLC traffic;coexistence design challenges;radio resource management problem;RRM;distributed risk- aware ML solution;URLLC traffic type;nonscheduled traffic types;hybrid orthogonal-nonorthogonal radio resource slicing","","28","","15","","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Considering versatile users' quality of service (QoS) requirements on transmission delay and rate, coarse resource provisioning scheme and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous slicing refinement algorithm are proposed. Then, a shape-based heuristic algorithm for user resource customization is devised to improve resource utilization and QoS satisfaction. In principle, the DQN algorithm allocates only the necessary resource to slices to satisfy users' QoS requirements. For fairness in comparison, we reserve all the unused resources back to the slices. In case there is a sudden change in user population in one slice, the algorithm provides isolation. To validate the advantage, system-level simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm balances the satisfaction up to about 100% and resource utilization up to 80% against state-of-the-art solutions.

In this scenario, PN resource utilization can be improved by introducing advanced orchestration functionalities that can intelligently assign and redistribute resources among the slices of different tenants according to the temporal variation of the VN resource requirements. This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues. The benefits of dynamic slicing come at a cost in terms of service degradation (i.e., when not all the resources required by a VN can be provided), but the paper shows that the service degradation level introduced by the proposed solutions is very small.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000A77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273270","5G transport;Dynamic slicing;IP over WDM;Multi-tenant networks;Network virtualization;Software defined networking","Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Optical fibers","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;software defined networking","dynamic slicing approach;multitenant 5G transport networks;physical network resource utilization;orchestration functionality;software defined networking;network slicing;virtual networks;mixed integer linear programming formulations;heuristic algorithms","","28","","","","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This serves to increase the resource efficiency of the infrastructure without degrading network slice performance. Traffic prediction is a common approach to determine this resource demand.State-of-the-art research has demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) predictors for traffic prediction in 5G networks. In this context, however, the problem is not only the accuracy of the predictor, but also the usability of the predicted values to drive resource orchestration and scheduling mechanisms, used for resource utilization optimization while ensuring performance.

Two key lessons learned are as follows. First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3108618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524814","6G;security and privacy;AI security;physical layer security;connection security;service security.","Security;6G mobile communication;Privacy;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Systematics;Standards","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

On one hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept can be helpful for enabling network infrastructure sharing/slicing and elasticity for “softwarization” of network elements. On the other hand, machine learning and game-theoretical concepts can also be utilized to address network management and orchestration needs of services and applications and improve network infrastructure's operational needs. In that regard, joint utilization of machine learning, game theoretical approaches and SDN concepts for network slicing can be beneficial to MNOs as well as infrastructure providers.

Traditionally, each vertical industry utilizes dedicated communications networks. In contrast, the 5th Generation of Mobile Communication Networks (5G) aims to fulfill Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vertical industries. This is achieved by deploying several, virtually dedicated networks, known as slices, on top of a unified, physical communication infrastructure. While various solutions have been presented for Core Network Slicing, the here presented approach aims to provide an end-to-end solution by allocating Radio Access Network (RAN) resources, realizing slicing for mission-critical applications via a novel scheduler design. A proof of concept is provided by way of detailed empirical evaluations, based on IoT scenarios from the energy sector (i.e., Smart Grids). The proposed RAN Network Slicing solution is shown to reliably sustain service guarantees of critical applications, while coexisting with non-critical services. Application-dependent, dynamic, inter-slice resource sharing enables an efficient use of available RAN spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate dynamic adaptation of slices to channel quality, ensuring reliable operation of Industrial IoT.","","978-1-7281-0960-2","10.1109/GCWkshps45667.2019.9024677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024677","","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Monitoring;Round robin;Mission critical systems;Quality of service;Resource management","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;software radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling","Radio Access Network resources;mission-critical applications;IoT scenarios;RAN Network Slicing solution;noncritical services;inter-slice resource sharing;available RAN spectrum;Industrial IoT;reliable software-defined RAN Network;mission-critical 5G Communication Networks;Industrial Internet of Things applications;communication infrastructures;Mobile Communication Networks;quality of service requirements;unified communication infrastructure;physical communication infrastructure;Core Network Slicing","","4","","16","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering that the dynamic of service demands makes it difficult to maintain high quality of user experience and high revenue of tenants, slice reconfiguration is necessary to avoid performance degradation. Hence, this paper proposes an optimal and fast slice reconfiguration (OFSR) solution by leveraging advanced deep reinforcement Learning. To deal with the uncertain changes in resources requirement, a demand prediction model based on Markov renewal process is introduced in decision-making. Taking into account the operation costs of reconfiguring diversified slices and the constraints of available resources, the proposed OFSR scheme aims at obtaining high long-term revenue with low operation cost. Given that the convergence of the conventional reinforcement learning approach is slow to learn the optimal reconfiguration policy for different classes of slices, deep dueling neural network combined with Q-learning is applied to improve the speed of convergence. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework is effective in achieving long-term revenue for tenants and the dueling deep Q-learning approach performs better than other current approaches.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322180","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822104,61771044); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:FRF-TP-19-051A1,FRF-BD-20-11A,FRF-TP-19-002C1,RC1631); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322180","Network Slicing;Slice Reconfiguration;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Resource Allocation;Dueling Deep Q-Learning","Resource management;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling;Bandwidth;Servers;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes","slice reconfiguration;performance degradation;demand prediction model;Markov renewal process;decision-making;diversified slices;long-term revenue;reinforcement learning;optimal reconfiguration policy;deep dueling neural network;dueling deep Q-learning;dueling deep reinforcement Learning;network slicing;differentiated service demands;multiple logical networks;user experience","","","","18","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as the dynamic traffic demands and the mobility in vehicular networks, how to perform RAN slicing efficiently to provide stable quality of service (QoS) for connected vehicles is still a challenge. In order to meet the diversified service request of vehicles in such a dynamic vehicular environment, in this paper, we propose a two-timescale radio resource allocation scheme, namely, LSTM-DDPG, to provide stable service for vehicles. Specifically, for the long-term dynamic characteristics of service request from vehicles, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) to follow the tracks, such that the dedicated resource allocation is executed in a long timescale by using historical data. On the other hand, for the impacts of channel changes caused by high-speed movement in a short period, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is leveraged to adjust the allocated resources. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-DDPG with simulation results, the cumulative probability that the slice supplies a stable performance to the served vehicle within the resource scheduling interval can reach more than 90%. Compared with the conventional deep Q-networks (DQN), the average cumulative probability has increased by 27.8%.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-8964-2","10.1109/VTC2021-Spring51267.2021.9448852","Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448852","Vehicular networks;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;resource allocation","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Tracking;Network slicing;Simulation;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;quality of service;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","two-timescale resource allocation scheme;vehicular network slicing;diverse use cases;heterogeneous requirements;dynamic traffic demands;vehicular networks;stable quality;connected vehicles;diversified service request;dynamic vehicular environment;two-timescale radio resource allocation scheme;LSTM-DDPG;stable service;long-term dynamic characteristics;short-term memory;dedicated resource allocation;long timescale;high-speed movement;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;deep deterministic policy gradient;allocated resources;served vehicle;resource scheduling interval;conventional deep Q-networks","","","","10","","15 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, there has been a huge investment from 5G Berlin Innovation Cluster to deliver a unique infrastructure providing opportunities for research centres, SMEs, and start-ups to develop novel solutions and products [1]. In this regard, there has been a complementary activity from Berlin Centre for Digital Transformation to develop a three-node optical network, which connects three Fraunhofer institutes, HHI, FOKUS, and IPK in a metro ring structure [2]. Additionally, there is a recently funded German national project (OTB-5G+) to develop an Open Testbed Berlin for 5G and Beyond, which will deliver a three-node ROADM network. These activities along with some other ones, like the presence of a Berlin node for two of the EU 5G trial projects (i.e., 5Genesis [3] and 5Gvinni [4]), have made Berlin a strategic spot in the evolution of the EU 5G ecosystem. Fraunhofer HHI hosts several aspects of the above-mentioned infrastructure including the 3-node ROADM metro network testbed, which provide a great opportunity to perform real-field experiments with 5G-ready RAN infrastructure and edge compute capability for realizing low-latency end-to-end use-cases. This metro network is SDN controlled and hosts edge compute node capabilities. Additionally, it could offer NFV services and will eventually support network slicing. Regarding the RAN infrastructure, currently, there are LTE base stations installed, which operate at 2.6 GHz. They will be upgraded to 5G base stations operating at 3.7 GHz as soon as they become available. The access segment, which is based on a passive WDM network, is expected to be extended by sophisticated mm-wave and optical-wireless communication links as bridges demonstrating the network extensions where optical fibers cannot be deployed. This network will be an SDN-enabled allowing the inclusion of several street 5G access points to the infrastructure. The three-node ROADM test-bed described above and shown in Fig. 1 will also host several demonstrations, including the final demonstration of metro-haul project [5]. Two of the ROADM nodes will be realized as AMEN (i.e., Access-Metro Edge Node) and the last one is MCEN (i.e., Metro-Core Edge Node), both developed in the framework of Metro-Haul project. This network will be also connected to German metro ring.

However, how to converge different types of services onto a common UAV network without deploying an individual network solution for each type of service is challenging. We tackle this challenge in this paper through slicing the UAV network, i.e., creating logical UAV networks customized for specific requirements. To this end, we formulate the UAV network slicing problem as a sequential decision problem to provide mobile broadband (MBB) services for ground mobile users while satisfying ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of UAV control and non-payload signal delivery. This problem, however, is difficult to be directly solved mainly due to the sequence-dependent characteristic and the lack of accurate location information of mobile users and accurate and tractable channel gain models in practice. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel solution approach based on learning and optimization methods. Particularly, we develop a distributed learning method to predict mobile users’ locations, where partial user location information stored on each UAV is utilized to train user location prediction networks. To achieve accurate channel gain models, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained by signal measurements at each UAV. To cope with the challenging sequence-dependent characteristic of the problem, we develop a Lyapunov-based optimization framework with provable performance guarantees to decompose the original problem into a sequence of separate optimization subproblems based on the learned results. Finally, an iterative optimization scheme joint with a successive convex approximation technique is exploited to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the Lyapunov-based optimization framework.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3088624","National Research Foundation, Singapore; Infocomm Media Development Authority through the Future Communications Research and Development Program; Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (ARF) Tier 2(grant numbers:T2EP20120-0006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453787","UAV network slicing;URLLC;mobile broadband service;learning and optimization","Ultra reliable low latency communication;Network slicing;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Payloads;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Resource management","","","","","","51","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing efficient scaling algorithms is challenging, especially for geo-distributed chains, where bandwidth costs and latencies incurred by the WAN traffic are important but difficult to handle in making scaling decisions. Existing studies have largely resorted to optimization algorithms in scaling design. Aiming at better decisions empowered by in-depth learning from experiences, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for scaling of the geo-distributed VNF chains, exploring inherent pattern of traffic variation and good deployment strategies over time. We novelly combine a recurrent neural network as the traffic model for predicting upcoming flow rates and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for making chain placement decisions.

The practical realization of such capability still raises numerous technical challenges, both in the Core and RAN parts of the 5G system. Through a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the realization of RAN slicing has on the different layers of the radio interface protocol architecture, this article proposes a framework for the support and specification of RAN slices based on the definition of a set of configuration descriptors that characterize the features, policies and resources to be put in place across the radio protocol layers of a next-generation RAN node.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253541","","5G mobile communication;Protocols;Radio access networks;Radio frequency;Resource management","5G mobile communication;protocols;radio access networks","5G radio access network slicing;future Fifth Generation networks;public safety;fixed wireless access;radio interface protocol architecture;radio protocol layers;next-generation RAN node;radio interface protocol","","51","","15","","10 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). While concluding the paper, it is shown that the LSTM has outperformed the rest of classification techniques with promising results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964697","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951149","Future internet architectures;machine learning;network reliability;privacy;resource management;security;software defined networks;vehicular networks","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security","5G mobile communication;computer network management;computer network reliability;convolutional neural nets;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","software defined networking;vehicular network environments;resource classification;convolutional neural network;deep neural network;5G vehicular network resource management;SDN-based 5G cellular network;vehicular Internet infrastructures;machine learning;radio access network;NFV;network function virtualization;flow-based policy framework;vehicle to vehicle communication;V2V communication;wireless virtualization;LSTM;long short-term memory;CNN;DNN","","9","","28","CCBY","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge of 5G is to assure the network performance and different quality of service (QoS) requirements of different services, such as machine type communication (MTC), enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) over 5G networks. Unlike the previous ”one size fits all” system, the softwarization, slicing and network capability exposure of 5G provide dynamic programming capabilities for QoS assurance. With the increasing complexity and dynamics of the network behaviors, it is non-trivial for a programmer to develop traditional software codes to schedule the network resources based on expert knowledge, especially when there is no quantitative relationship among the network events and the QoS anomalies. Machine learning is a computer technology that gives computer systems the ability to learn with data and improve performance and accuracy of decision making on a specific task, without being explicitly programmed. The areas of machine learning and communication technology are converging. Supervised learning based QoS assurance architecture for 5G networks was proposed in this paper. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can intelligently learn the network environment and react to dynamic situations. They can learn from the fore passed QoS related information and anomalies, and further reconstruct the relationship between the fore passed data and the current QoS related anomalies automatically and accurately. They, then, can trigger automatic mitigation or provide suggestions. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can also predict future QoS related anomalies with high confidence. In this paper, a case study for QoS anomaly root cause tracking based on decision tree was given to validate the proposed framework architecture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907142","Hubei Province Technology Innovation Project(grant numbers:2018ADC049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673765","5G;architecture;quality of service;supervised learning","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Computer architecture;Training;Knowledge engineering","5G mobile communication;decision making;decision trees;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;synchronisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability","supervised machine learning mechanisms;QoS anomaly root cause tracking;QoS assurance architecture;5G networks;ubiquitous connectivity;high-speed data transfer;machine type communication;enhanced mobile broad band;ultra-reliable low latency communications;network capability exposure;dynamic programming capabilities;network resources;computer technology;computer systems;communication technology;quality of service;software codes;URLLC;MTC;eMBB","","10","","33","OAPA","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the hardware-specific MAR is costly and heavy, and the App-based MAR requires an additional download and installation and it also lacks cross-platform ability. These limitations hamper the pervasive promotion of MAR. This paper argues that mobile Web AR (MWAR) holds the potential to become a practical and pervasive solution that can effectively scale to millions of end-users because MWAR can be developed as a lightweight, cross-platform, and low-cost solution for end-to-end delivery of MAR. The main challenges for making MWAR a reality lie in the low efficiency for dense computing in Web browsers, a large delay for real-time interactions over mobile networks, and the lack of standardization. The good news is that the newly emerging 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) cellular networks can mitigate these issues to some extent via techniques such as network slicing, device-to-device communication, and mobile edge computing. In this paper, we first give an overview of the challenges and opportunities of MWAR in the 5G era. Then we describe our design and development of a generic service-oriented framework (called MWAR5) to provide a scalable, flexible, and easy to deploy MWAR solution. We evaluate the performance of our MWAR5 system in an actually deployed 5G trial network under the collaborative configurations, which shows encouraging results. Moreover, we also share the experiences and insights from our development and deployment, including some exciting future directions of MWAR over 5G and B5G networks.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2019.09.010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851462","5G;edge computing;augmented reality;mobile augmented reality;Web augmented reality","5G mobile communication;Browsers;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Augmented reality;Edge computing;Smart phones","5G mobile communication;augmented reality;groupware;Internet;mobile computing;smart phones","mobile Web AR;low-cost solution;dense computing;Web browsers;mobile networks;device-to-device communication;mobile edge computing;MWAR5 system;wearable devices;computer vision;hardware-specific MAR;cross-platform ability;B5G networks;mobile augmented reality;mobile Web augmented reality;5G trial network;app-based MAR;collaborative configurations","","6","","","","27 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is based upon a “chop” operation for splitting features (columns) and a “slice” operation for clustering instances (rows). However, a number of techniques can be applied to chop and slice meaning that LearnSPN can learn a wide variety of SPNs from the same dataset. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of LearnSPN. We consider g-test and mutual information for chopping and k-means and Gaussian mixture models for slicing. Our experiments, conducted on 20 real-world datasets, suggest that the deepest SPNs tend to be learned when using mutual information for chopping and k-means for slicing. This is important, since SPNs are the only deep learning model where it is provably the case that deeper models are more expressive than shallow models. Second, our results show that the pair of g-test and Gaussian mixture models tends to yield the most accurate SPNs, especially on larger datasets. These results suggest that the particular combination of mutual information and k-means may be prone to overfitting. Lastly, we examine the sparseness of the learned SPN. Our experiments show that the pair of g-test and Gaussian mixture models regularly yields SPNs with fewer edges. This knowledge is beneficial to SPN learning algorithms that penalize networks with more edges. Our study then extends the SPN deep learning literature in both practical and theoretical directions.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280810","","Mutual information;Clustering algorithms;Gaussian mixture model;Machine learning;Computer science;Electronic mail","Gaussian processes;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","sum-product networks;LearnSPN;standard unsupervised learning algorithm;chop operation;splitting features;slice operation;clustering instances;SPNs;SPN learning algorithms;shallow models;deeper models;deep learning model;deepest SPNs;real-world datasets;slicing;Gaussian mixture models;chopping;mutual information","","1","","25","","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, intelligent content caching, which places popular contents at the network edge, can help relieve the backhaul congestion and improve user quality of service (QoS). Joint content caching and network slicing in the wireless backhaul based 5G networks, however, present great potential and challenges. In this paper, we study the joint resource allocation and content caching problem which aims to efficiently orchestrate the resource management in both wireless access and backhaul networks and caching storage repository. Our design objective is to minimize the maximum content request outage probability experienced by users associated with different cells and from different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The underlying optimization problem is a mixed- integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is difficult to tackle. We propose a bisection-search based algorithm that iteratively optimizes the resource allocation and content caching strategy.

We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are problematic and large. We propose SliceFinder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques.

Learning assisted slicing and concurrent resource allocation process is jointly exploited in this proposed method to improve the users’ service reliability.

To deal with security concerns of in-vehicle networks, various deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) have been developed to enhance in-vehicle security. However, the DL/RL agents are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation, where an attacker can perform a manipulation attack to interfere with the agent’s operation. In this work, we aim to develop two key mechanisms to build secure in-vehicle networks: (1) RL-based proactive defense mechanism to achieve multiple objectives of minimizing system security vulnerabilities while maximizing service availability; and (2) a resilient RL method that allows an agent to operate in the presence of adversarial disturbances that neutralize the system security.

We have proposed an adaptive radio access network (RAN) system to support communication services called the advanced 5G system. The RAN slice is defined as a logical network able to provide a variety of services separately in a RAN. In adaptive RAN, an efficient slice admission control (SAC) scheme for RAN slices is required. Recently, research on applying a machine learning (ML) to facilitate efficient slice resource management and SAC in 5G RAN slicing environments has been discussed. However, the training time for the existing SAC scheme based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework (DRLF) takes too long to achieve an acceptable level of performance. Since it takes a long time to learn, it is difficult to guarantee sufficient performance in the early phase of the operating period. In this paper, we propose a SAC based on an ensemble learning method (ELM) to reduce learning time and improve performance for the adaptive RAN. Our evaluation with ELM for the improved utilization of resource blocks (RBs) shows that the proposed approach outperforms the other approaches.","","978-1-7281-7307-8","10.1109/GCWkshps50303.2020.9367536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367536","5G;Adaptive RAN;RAN Slicing;Slice Admission Control;Ensemble Learning;Reinforcement Learning","Training;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Reinforcement learning;Resource management;Reliability;Radio access networks","5G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability","communication services;advanced 5G system;RAN slice;adaptive RAN;machine learning;efficient slice resource management;future 5G system;performance targets;high reliability;adaptive radio access network system;ensemble learning method-based slice admission control scheme;logical network;SAC scheme;5G RAN slicing environments;deep reinforcement learning framework;DRLF;ELM;resource blocks","","","","18","","5 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, this is associated with high costs and lengthy roll-out times. Therefore it is desirable for multiple tenants to share one Physical Network (PN). However, this may compromise service guarantees, potentially violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Network slicing aims to address this challenge by transparently dividing one common infrastructure into multiple, logically independent networks. Thereby tenants are isolated from one another, ensuring the fulfillment of hard performance guarantees. As slicing is central to realizing the potential of 5G networks, this work presents a novel approach based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) driven queueing strategies.

To this end, we present DeepCog, a novel data analytics tool for the cognitive management of resources in 5G systems. DeepCog forecasts the capacity needed to accommodate future traffic demands within individual network slices while accounting for the operator's desired balance between resource overprovisioning (i.e., allocating resources exceeding the demand) and service request violations (i.e., allocating less resources than required). To achieve its objective, DeepCog hinges on a deep learning architecture that is explicitly designed for capacity forecasting. Comparative evaluations with real-world measurement data prove that DeepCog's tight integration of machine learning into resource orchestration allows for substantial (50% or above) reduction of operating expenses with respect to resource allocation solutions based on state-of-the-art mobile traffic predictors.

Beyond 5G, some fundamental issues that need to be addressed are higher system capacity, higher data rate, lower latency, higher security, and improved quality of service (QoS) compared to the 5G system. This paper presents the vision of future 6G wireless communication and its network architecture. This article describes emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, terahertz communications, wireless optical technology, free-space optical network, blockchain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communications, unmanned aerial vehicles, cell-free communications, integration of wireless information and energy transfer, integrated sensing and communication, integrated access-backhaul networks, dynamic network slicing, holographic beamforming, backscatter communication, intelligent reflecting surface, proactive caching, and big data analytics that can assist the 6G architecture development in guaranteeing the QoS. Besides, expected applications with 6G communication requirements and possible technologies are presented. We also describe potential challenges and research directions for achieving this goal.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2020.3010270","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) through the International Cooperative Research and Development Program(grant numbers:P0011880); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2017-0-00824); Development of Intelligent and Hybrid OCC-LiFi Systems for Next Generation Optical Wireless Communications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144301","5G;6G;artificial intelligence;automation;beyond 5G;data rate;massive connectivity;virtual reality;terahertz","5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Artificial intelligence;Quality of service;Market research;Sensors","4G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;array signal processing;autonomous aerial vehicles;Big Data;next generation networks;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology","backscatter communication;6G architecture development;wireless communication;wireless connectivity;fourth-generation communications;sixth-generation system;artificial intelligence;higher system capacity;terahertz communications;wireless optical technology;free-space optical network;quantum communications;cell-free communications;integrated access-backhaul networks","","44","","89","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, since extremely big data accesses among fast driving vehicles of unreliable V2X communications through both 5G contention-based random access interfaces: PC5 and sidelink V2X obviously increase contention collision probability, this clearly degrades the performance of delay, loss, and goodput.

The network has to decide to accept or reject the requests, and scale up/down the slices by considering the user density in accepted requests, and then, schedule the accepted requests to serve them in an order.

In this context, we formulate a binary non-convex problem that maximizes the aggregate capacity of multiple network slices. The resulting spectrum allocation minimizes the inter-numerology interference under the frequent channel fluctuations characterizing the various users. To address the computational complexity of the designed objective function, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design a model-free solution computation. In detail, the trained centralized DRL agent exploits the channel fading statistic in order to provide a spectrum allocation that minimizes the inter-numerology interference.

Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service.

Software defined networking offers a high degree of flexibility for implementing such networking solutions to improve the performance of smart homes. In prior works on SDHN, the focus was either on slicing the control plane or on traffic management in the data plane of the home networks.

These two extreme services are envisaged to agglomerate together into critical mMTC shortly with emerging use cases (e.g., wide-area disaster monitoring, wireless factory automation), creating new challenges to designing wireless systems beyond 5G. While conventional network slicing is effective in supporting a simple mixture of mMTC and URLLC, it is difficult to simultaneously guarantee the reliability, latency, and scalability requirements of critical mMTC (e.g., ¡ 4ms latency, 10<sup>6</sup> devices/km<sup>2</sup> for factory automation) with limited radio resources. Furthermore, recently proposed solutions to scalable URLLC (e.g., machine learning aided URLLC for driverless vehicles) are ill-suited to critical mMTC whose machine type users have minimal energy budget and computing capability that should be (tightly) optimized for given tasks. To this end, our paper aims to characterize promising use cases of critical mMTC and search for their possible solutions.

However, user mobility’s impact on the optimal resource allocation within and between slices deserves more attention. Slices and their dedicated resources should be offered where the services are to be consumed to minimize network latency and associated overheads and costs. Different mobility patterns lead to different resource re-allocation triggers, leading eventually to slice mobility when enough resources are to be migrated. The selection of the proper triggers for resource re-allocation and related slice mobility patterns is challenging due to triggers’ multiplicity and overlapping nature. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of two Deep Reinforcement Learning based algorithms for allowing a fine-grained selection of mobility triggers that may instantiate slice and resource mobility actions. While the first proposed algorithm relies on a value-based learning method, the second one exploits a hybrid approach to optimize the action selection process. We present an enhanced ETSI Network Function Virtualization edge computing architecture that incorporates the studied mechanisms to implement service and slice migration.

In this article, an architecture comprising multi-domain edge orchestration (MDEO) entrusted by blockchain designed to solve the problem of multi-constraint QoS is proposed. A dynamic end-to-end (E2E) network slicing algorithm is devised to execute at the MDEO to enable multi-tenant on-demand network infrastructure provisioning isolation and security. The algorithm first calculates an optimum network slice topology and then instantiates the involved virtual network functions. Based on multi-constraint QoS, it fulfills the E2E slice request.

We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are large and problematic. We propose Slice Finder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731353","data slicing;model validation","Data models;Decision trees;Lattices;Search problems;Analytical models;Training;Loss measurement","data mining;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;program slicing;statistical analysis","model performance problems;slicing data;validation data;model validation;arbitrary slices;interpretable slices;arbitrary subsets;Slice Finder;model fairness;automated data slicing;machine learning systems","","3","","11","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reaping the benefits of MIMO transmission can be fully harnessed if the channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter side. However, the acquisition of transmitter side CSI entails many challenges. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted CSI estimation technique in highly mobile vehicular networks, based on the fact that the propagation environment (scatterers, reflectors) is almost identical thereby allowing a data driven deep neural network (DNN) to learn the non-linear CSI relations with negligible overhead. Moreover, we formulate and solve a dynamic network slicing based resource allocation problem for vehicular user equipments (VUEs) requesting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC) traffic slices. The formulation considers a threshold rate violation probability minimization for the eMBB slice while satisfying a probabilistic threshold rate criterion for the URLLC slice. Simulation result shows that an overhead reduction of 50% can be achieved with 12% increase in threshold violations compared to an ideal case with perfect CSI knowledge.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-7440-2","10.1109/ICCWorkshops49005.2020.9145297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145297","5G and beyond;deep learning;V2X;resource allocation;URLLC;eMBB;network slicing","Resource management;Downlink;Machine learning;Reliability;Estimation;Wireless communication;MIMO communication","5G mobile communication;channel estimation;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave scattering;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;minimisation;neural nets;probability;radio transmitters;radiowave propagation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","VUE;enhanced mobile broadband;ultrareliable low latency traffic slices;threshold rate violation probability minimization;probabilistic threshold rate criterion;vehicular user equipments;dynamic network slicing;DNN;propagation environment;fifth generation wireless communication systems;multiple-input multiple-output system;joint URLLC-eMBB resource allocation;resource allocation problem;nonlinear CSI relations;deep neural network;highly mobile vehicular networks;channel state information;MIMO transmission;energy efficiency;higher spectrum efficiency;5G wireless communication systems;deep learning assisted CSI estimation","","2","","20","","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the reservation of these resources will come at an additional cost to the SP, which motivates the main objective of this paper: To develop a strategy that will allow the SP to determine the optimal amount of resources it should reserve ahead of time so that its future QoS constraints are met with minimal risk of revenue loss (i.e. from over reservation).

To implement the time slicing at the base station for reducing power consumption of smart phones, a regulation buffer is allocated at the base station. All incoming packets for individual user equipments (UEs) are temporarily buffered at the base station and then transmitted in individual bursts using the overall bandwidth. Under such a design, each UE can receive packets in a very short period and then enter the DRX sleep or idle cycle for a longer period, yielding better power saving performance. For VoD services, a playback buffering delay is usually required at the UE to compensate for the network jitter. Hence, shifting part of the playback buffering delay at the UE to the base station nearly degrades the playout quality of VoD services. Mathematical analyses for power saving ratios of the regular DRX and the proposed traffic regulation plus time slicing mechanisms are given in this paper. Analytical results show that the proposed traffic regulation plus time slicing scheme reduces power consumption of UEs much more effectively, compared with the regular DRX mechanism.","2165-8536","978-1-4673-9991-3","10.1109/ICUFN.2016.7536933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536933","DRX;LTE-A;power saving;time slicing;traffic regulation;video-on-demand (VoD);wireless cellular networks","Base stations;Power demand;Delays;Videos;Bandwidth;Jitter;Mathematical model","cellular radio;jitter;Long Term Evolution;smart phones;telecommunication traffic;video on demand","traffic regulation-plus-time slicing scheme;power saving;video-on-demand services;power consumption reduction;smart phones;DRX-based LTE networks;DRX-based LTE-A networks;VoD services;regulation buffer allocation;base station;user equipments;DRX sleep cycle;DRX idle cycle;playback buffering delay;network jitter compensation;playout quality degradation;wireless cellular networks","","1","","15","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this increased complexity, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents itself as an optimal solution. In this work, we propose a dynamic DRL-based management framework for virtual cache slicing and customized content placement. The virtualization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and it utilizes a deep Q-network to autonomously make network-wide slicing decisions and optimize the cache resource allocation. These global decisions are then mapped to the small cell stations with a dynamic resource provisioning algorithm. Lastly, a customized content placement algorithm is used to find the optimal content placement policy for each service provider.

Our idea is to partition a DCI into non-overlapped subgraphs, divide the VNT slicing in each subgraph into four collaborative steps, and get tenants involved in the calculation of virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes. With our proposal, an agent of infrastructure provider (InP) leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to price, and advertise the substrate resources in one subgraph, motivates tenants to request resources in a load-balanced manner, and accepts VNE schemes from the tenants to avoid resource conflicts. Meanwhile, the tenants' task is to compute their own VNE schemes independently, and distributedly according to the resource information (i.e., the available resources, and their prices) advertised by the agent. We first design the DRL model based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and develop a VNT compression method based on auto-encoder (AE) to generalize the DRL's operation. Then, we study how to resolve resource conflicts among the distributedly-calculated VNE schemes, build a conflict graph (CG) to transform the VNE selection into finding the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in the CG, and design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the problem. Extensive simulations confirm that compared with the centralized service framework relying solely on the InP for VNE calculation, our proposed DRL-assisted distributed framework provisions VNT requests with significantly shorter computation time, and comparable blocking performance.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3023693","NSFC Project(grant numbers:61871357,61771445,61701472); Zhejiang Lab Research Fund(grant numbers:2019LE0AB01); Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Project(grant numbers:QYZDY-SSW-JSC003); SPR Program of CAS(grant numbers:XDC02070300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195739","Auto-encoder (AE);datacenter interconnections (DCIS);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);distributed and parallel operation;virtual network embedding (VNE)","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Substrates;Topology;Pricing;Approximation algorithms;Virtualization","approximation theory;computer centres;computer networks;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;resource allocation;virtualisation","DRL-assisted service framework;datacenter interconnections;cost-effectiveness;time-efficiency;nonoverlapped subgraphs;VNT slicing;InP;deep reinforcement learning;substrate resources;load-balanced manner;resource information;DRL model;deep deterministic policy gradient;VNT compression method;polynomial-time approximation algorithm;centralized service framework;shorter computation time;DCI;conflict graph;maximum weighted independent set;MWIS;DDPG;tenant-driven virtual network slicing","","","","46","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network slicing is a promising technique for supporting M2M traffic on 6G networks as there is a need to concurrently support varying Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of M2M devices. A major bottleneck for M2M traffic is the Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure, which has to be performed for all devices, which results in the same latency for all service types. Due to the event-driven simultaneous access behavior of M2M devices, this procedure can cause severe congestion. Legacy congestion control schemes such as Access Class Barring (ACB) are not adequate to handle the overload in bursty traffic scenarios, which can happen frequently in M2M communications. There is also no clear guideline to adjust ACB parameters dynamically in such situations. Here we propose a multi-rate ACB algorithm using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tune the barring rates of different service classes. Our priority-based algorithm not only reduces the congestion but also slices the RACH among different service types. Comprehensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm maximizes the RACH utilization. In the meantime, based on each service priority, it reduces the delays and increases the access probability even when the connection requests exceed the RACH capacity.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473684","Reinforcement Learning (RL);RAN Slicing;Massive Machine Type Communication;Congestion Control;Access Class Barring (ACB)","6G mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Machine-to-machine communications;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Simulation;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","11","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handoff policy with data Sharing, named LESS, to reduce handoff cost while maintaining user QoS requirements in RAN slicing. Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761736","","Quality of service;Switches;Radio access networks;Distributed databases;Network architecture;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth","learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication computing","handoff mechanism;future mobile networks;extremely diverse communication requirements;UE-BS-NS;three-layer association;conventional policies;handoff cost;user QoS requirements;RAN slicing;action space;multiple users;data sparsity problem;user mobility;modified distributed Q-learning algorithm;handoff decisions;data sharing mechanism;LESS mechanism;target base station;traditional handoff policies;smart handoff policy;tailored quality of service;multiagent reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing","","6","","12","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel type of features - hybrid deep features, for scene images. Specifically, we exploit both object-based and scene-based features at two levels: part image level (i.e., parts of an image) and whole image level (i.e., a whole image), which produces a total number of four types of deep features. Regarding the part image level, we also propose two new slicing techniques to extract part based features. Finally, we aggregate these four types of deep features via the concatenation operator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid deep features on three commonly used scene datasets (MIT-67, Scene-15, and Event-8), in terms of the scene image classification task. Extensive comparisons show that our introduced features can produce state-of-the-art classification accuracies which are more consistent and stable than the results of existing features across all datasets.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207106","Deep learning;Feature extraction;Hybrid deep features;Image classification;Image representation;Machine learning","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Semantics;Image representation;Australia;Aggregates;Computer vision","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","scene image classification task;hybrid deep features;image representations;object-based features;scene-based features;part image level;part based features;HDF;whole image level;deep features;slicing techniques;concatenation operator","","1","","40","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For meeting the targets of 5G NR, multiple features like scalable numerology, flexible spectrum, forward compatibility, and ultra-lean design are added as compared to the LTE systems. This paper presents a brief overview of the added features and key performance indicators of 5G NR. The issues related to the adaptation of higher modulation schemes and inter-RAT handover synchronization are well addressed in this paper. With the consideration of these challenges, a next-generation wireless communication architecture is proposed. The architecture acts as the platform for migration towards beyond 5G/6G networks. Along with this, various technologies and applications of 6G networks are also overviewed in this paper. 6G network will incorporate Artificial intelligence (AI) based services, edge computing, quantum computing, optical wireless communication, hybrid access, and tactile services.

Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Network Slicing (NS) are gaining momentum not only in research but also in IT industry representing the drivers of 5G. NS is an approach to network operations allowing the partition of a physical topology into multiple independent virtual networks, called network slices (or slices). Within a single slice, a set of Service Function Chains (SFCs) is defined and the network resources, e.g. bandwidth, can be provisioned dynamically on demand according to specific Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Traditional schemes for network resources provisioning based on static policies may lead to poor resource utilization and suffer from scalability issues. In this article, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for performing dynamic SFC resources allocation in NFV-SDN enabled metro-core optical networks. RL allows to build a self-learning system able to solve highly complex problems by employing RL agents to learn policies from an evolving network environment. In particular, we build an RL system able to optimize the resources allocation of SFCs in a multi-layer network (packet over flexi-grid optical layer). The RL agent decides if and when to reconfigure the SFCs, given state of the network and historical traffic traces.

The techniques to efficiently allocate the available radio resources to different slices based on their requirements and their priority, also known as inter-slice radio resource management, has been the subject of many studies. The formerly proposed algorithms either assume the slices request maximum contracted data rates or they react passively as the demands arrive. This paper proposes to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to learn the pattern of the traffic demand of each network slices and predict the demands in the next decision interval. Based on the prediction of the slices' demands, a novel model for elastic inter-slice radio resource management is proposed to increase the multiplexing gain while not compromising the quality of offered connectivity services to the slices. The proposed model is evaluated using a practical scenario. The numeric results show that while the performance of the model under full demand is similar to former models, its elastic resource management enables more efficient resource allocation when the traffic demands vary over time.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-0546-8","10.1109/EuCNC.2019.8801995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8801995","","","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","elastic slice-aware radio resource management;AI-traffic prediction;network slicing;mobile networks;multiple network slices;different slices;traffic demand;elastic inter-slice radio resource management;contracted data rates;5G networks;network virtualisation;artificial intelligence approaches","","1","","13","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Matching-based detection methods extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching. Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives) and high precision (91.95% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the capability of our method.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050051","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1836209,61802413); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China(grant numbers:19XNLG02,20XNLG03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316905","Vulnerable smart contracts;graph embedding;bytecode matching","Smart contracts;Task analysis;Interference;Blockchain;Prototypes;Business;Virtual machining","contracts;graph theory;pattern matching;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;unsupervised learning","matching-based detection methods;resultant financial losses;smart contract vulnerabilities;graph embedding;honeypot contracts;potentially vulnerable smart contracts;unsupervised graph;simulated bytecode executions;contract-specific slicing;instruction-level normalizations;bytecode matching;slicing techniques;homogeneous business logics;noise code;bytecode generation","","","","48","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, an application generating bursty traffic such as video streaming causes congestion during the classification, which degrades QoE due to a considerable classification delay. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called Progressive Slicing, which adaptively assigns the flow to multiple slices according to the state of the classifications. This new classification mechanism mitigates the classification delay by progressively isolating flows into the slices in the course of the classifications. In addition, multiple stages of classifications improve accuracy and enable more flexible application slicing based on the confidence scores.

To mitigate system overloading, our framework dynamically adjusts resources allocated to low priority slices, thereby reducing the dropping probability of new slice requests. The proposed algorithm offers outstanding advantages over traditional static approaches by automatically adapting the controller decisions to the system changes. Simulation results show that our framework significantly improves the resource utilization and reduces the slice request dropping probabilities up to 44% as compared to the baseline schemes.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2019.2952882","France-Singapore MERLION 2017-2018, Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906,WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier(grant numbers:1 2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015- NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWTEP003- 041); 5G-MoNArch project(grant numbers:761445); Phase II of the 5th Generation Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) program partially; European Commission within the Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896931","Network slicing;reinforcement learning;admission and congestion control","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Noise measurement;Computer architecture","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network planning","slice request dropping probabilities;online algorithm;arrival characteristics;departure characteristics;5G services;5G networks;cross-slice admission;network slicing;slice deployment;artificial intelligence framework;resource utilization;controller decisions;low priority slices;smart feature extraction solution;operator revenue;storage resources;congestion control","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Past studies of dynamic network provisioning mostly consider dynamic bandwidth and delay assignment in order to maximize the system throughput and minimize communication overhead. These studies leveraged Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to create dedicated end-to-end virtual networks which are called network slices. But, these works are lack of consideration of provisioning a dynamic network based on request locations where users would use the network to deploy their services. In this paper, a method for generating a network slice dynamically based on requested locations of users is proposed to support the location-aware dynamic network provisioning. The requested locations are obtained by users through a web interface, then the requested locations are encapsulated and sent to SDN controller which knows the geographical location of SDN switches. Then SDN controller sets up a location-aware network slice. To provide a viability of the proposed approach, we implemented the web interface and the protocol to share the requested locations.","","978-1-5386-1101-2","10.1109/APNOMS.2017.8094142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094142","Dynamic Network Provisioning;Software-defined networks;Network Function Virtualization;Location-aware Network Provisioning","Bandwidth;Protocols;Generators;Heuristic algorithms;Servers","protocols;quality of service;software defined networking;virtualisation","network function virtualization;leveraged software defined network;network quality of service;QoS;SDN switches;end-to-end virtual networks;SDN controller;location-aware network slice;request locations;delay assignment;dynamic bandwidth;service requirements;network services;location-aware dynamic network provisioning","","","","8","","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, early detection of AD is crucial to start treatments to decelerate the progress of the disease and to maximize patients' quality of life. With the rapid advances in machine learning and scanning, early detection of AD may be possible via computer-assisted systems using neuroimaging data. Among all, deep learning utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a prominent tool due to its capability to extract high-level features through local connectivity, weight sharing, and spatial invariance. This paper describes our investigation of the classification accuracy based on two publicly available data sets, namely, ADNI and OASIS, by building a 3D VGG variant convolutional network (CNN). We used 3D models to avoid information loss, which occurs during the process of slicing 3D MRI into 2D images and analyzing them by 2D convolutional filters.

These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals.

Consequentially, the latency impact of radio resource management on the end-to-end latency is optimized in this work by using so-called Configured Grants (CGs), which aim to minimize latency-intensive scheduling requests by pre-allocating radio resources. As predicting future traffic demands and channel conditions are required to use CGs, a data-driven machine learning-based radio resource scheduler prototype is introduced and evaluated in this work based on a specifically developed 5G radio resource simulator.

In such an environment, we are particularly interested in supervising network slicing, a recent tool enabling to create multiple virtual networks for different applications and QoS constraints on a Telco infrastructure. The goal is to infer the underlay resources states from the measurements performed in the overlay structure. We model the inference task as a regression problem that we solve following a Neural Network approach. Since getting labeled data for the training phase can be costly, our procedure generates artificial data for the training phase. By creating a large set of random training examples, the Neural Network learns the relations between the measures done at path and link levels. This approach takes advantage of efficient Machine Learning solutions to solve a classic inference problem. Simulations with a public dataset show very promising results compared to statistical-based methods. We explored mainly additive metrics such as delays or logs of loss rates, but the approach can also be used for non-additive ones such as bandwidth.","2331-9860","978-1-7281-3893-0","10.1109/CCNC46108.2020.9045301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045301","","Monitoring;Measurement;Tomography;Training;Network topology;Neural networks;Overlay networks","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;overlay networks;quality of service;regression analysis;software defined networking;virtualisation","TOM;Network tomography;internal network characteristics;end-to-end correlated measurements;link metrics inference;network slicing;multiple virtual networks;neural network approach;training phase;classic inference problem;self-trained tomography solution;SDN-NFV environment;tomography for overlay network monitoring;QoS constraints;Telco infrastructure;regression problem;artificial data generation;statistical-based methods;machine learning;additive metrics","","1","","20","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such approaches to the design of EDMs have invariably adopted a fault model with a single-fault assumption, limiting the relevance of the detectors and their evaluation. Software containing more than a single fault is commonplace, with safety standards recognizing that critical failures are often the result of unlikely or unforeseen combinations of faults. This paper addresses this shortcoming, demonstrating that it is possible to generate efficient EDMs under simultaneous fault models. In particular, it is shown that (i) efficient EDMs can be designed using fault injection data collected under models accounting for the occurrence of simultaneous faults, (ii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can yield improved EDM efficiency, (iii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can be made non-exhaustive and (iv) EDMs can be relocated within a software system using program slicing, reducing the resource costs of experimentation to practicable levels without sacrificing EDM efficiency.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266977","detection;error;model;location;machine learning","","","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

On the other hand, the development of neural networks and deep learning in many fields has led researchers to consider the possibility of applying them to solve the program synthesis problems. In this paper, we took the probabilistic program synthesis realized by the neural network as the research subject and noticed that most of the current work borrows from the structure of encoding and decoding in natural language processing. We analyzed its two possible disadvantages, one is the performance degradation of the long-sequence structure, the other is that synthesized results without validation are too redundant. We took a probabilistic encoder-decoder neural model named BAYOU as an example to analyze the specific problem. We proposed a framework named PASS which contains several methods to solve those problems and improve the model performance. For the former problem, we showed how to adapt neural networks to increase the attention mechanism to address the problem of information forgetting and long sequences unmanageable. Then, we combined the program slicing in the field of program analysis to slice the generated program, thereby eliminated redundant code of result from methods without validation and had a more refined result. The experiment showed that the accuracy of neural program synthesis guided from our approach improved by a mean of 17%, up to a maximum of 22%.

Simulation results show that compared with QoS-based wireless resource allocation algorithm (QoS-WRA) and wireless resource dynamic allocation algorithm (WRDA), SAOA has stronger advantages in saving energy consumption and ensuring transmission rate.","","978-1-7281-1304-3","10.1109/ICECOME.2018.8644858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644858","network slice;smart grid;resource allocation;wireless access network;service ckassification","Resource management;Quality of service;Heuristic algorithms;Interference;Wireless networks;Substrates","concave programming;energy consumption;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;simulated annealing;telecommunication power management;virtualisation","network slice optimization method;wireless access networks;smart grid;communication services;wireless resource slicing problem;substrate wireless resources;virtual wireless resources;wireless resource dynamic allocation algorithm;simulated annealing optimization algorithm;SAOA;QoS-WRA;WRDA;energy consumption;nonconvex optimization model","","","","12","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though semi-automated and fully automated methods have been developed for left ventricular segmentation, they suffer from a number of drawbacks. These drawbacks include the dependence on large sets of training data and assumptions about the distribution of the intensities of the image. This paper proposes a novel volumetric segmentation algorithm based on an angular slicing approach for 3-D echocardiography scans and a diffeomorphic nonrigid registration method. The proposed method is fast, reproducible, and yields a volumetric segmentation with minimal user interaction. The algorithm was evaluated on 30 participants from the challenge on endocardial 3-D ultrasound segmentation dataset from the medical image computing and computer assisted interventions Challenge 2014. The proposed method yielded the following average distance metrics for the end diastolic volumes: 1) mean absolute distance of 2.36 mm, 2) Hausdorff distance of 8.25 mm, and 3) Dice score of 0.887. For the end systolic volumes, the following average distance metrics were obtained: 1) mean absolute distance of 2.33 mm, 2) Hausdorff distance of 8.95 mm, and 3) Dice score of 0.857. The following clinical metrics for the ejection fraction are reported: 1) modified correlation coefficient of 0.169, 2) bias in mL of −3.96 mL, and 3) standard deviation of 6.85 mL.

Then we address a significant and realistic scenario, where there is a lack of trust between market players. This typically occurs when the central slice broker has conflicting interests (e.g., being simultaneously infrastructure provider and virtual operator). We propose a distributed market design, lever-aging smart contracts technology, where the brokering mechanism is operated and validated by all of the parties involved. In addition, we use blockchain technology to enable a manipulation-proof record-keeping system, where a record is accepted into the ledger only when all the parties have reached a consensus to do so. We deploy a realistic blockchain application/network hosted on the cloud-based Hyperledger Fabric framework. Finally, we investigate the performance of the blockchain-based slice brokering market in terms of transaction latency, throughput and computing intensity. Our results show that the proposed market could support 100 auction transactions per second with a latency below one second, which would add no considerable delay even to a highly dynamic slicing market mechanism.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-4355-2","10.1109/EuCNC48522.2020.9200915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200915","Blockchain;Slice Brokering;Network Slicing;Smart Contract;Telecommunications Operators;Virtual Network Operators","Peer-to-peer computing;5G mobile communication;Contracts;Ecosystems;Throughput","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;cryptography","computing intensity;throughput intensity;transaction latency;dynamic slicing market mechanism;blockchain-based slice brokering market;cloud-based hyperledger fabric framework;manipulation-proof record-keeping system;blockchain technology;brokering mechanism;distributed market design;virtual operator;central slice broker;dynamically provision slices;network operators;dynamic mechanism;distributed blockchain-based market;5G network slice brokering","","1","","28","","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, deep learning (DL) based CQE methods are proposed to achieve a good identification performance. However, existing methods are hard to extract full features from baseband signals, due to the fact that their deep neural networks are trained from the limited length of signal samples. In order to avoid this problem, we consider two training models. The first one is transforming baseband signals into constellation diagrams and three kinds of DL algorithms (i.e., AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet) are applied respectively for training. The second one is slicing IQ signals into multi-slices signals and convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied and CQE is a joint multi-slice and cooperative decision.

Therefore, in this paper, a multi-sliced sampling-based DFR (Mss-DFR) model is proposed to solve the above problems in high-dimension datasets. The improved model is different from the original model in three important aspects. Firstly, considering the diversity and time cost of sub-forest, the raw feature vector is segmented into three parts through multi slicing strategy. Further, based on the mutual information feature selection model, the optimized feature set is obtained that according to the principle of minimum redundancy and maximum correlation, and then combined with the layer regression vector. Finally, consider variance can projection effect the difference of each sub-forest in DFR, so that it added to the layer regression vector. Experimental results show that Mss-DFR performs significantly, and even outperforms neural networks and achieves state-of-the-art results in some cases.","","978-1-7281-8216-2","10.1109/IAI50351.2020.9262209","National Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2018YFC1900800-5); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573364,61873009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262209","Deep Learning;Deep Forest Regression;Multi-slice Sampling;Mutual Information","Forestry;Radio frequency;Manganese;Training;Predictive models;Decision trees;Reactive power","feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;regression analysis","Mss-DFR performs;multisliced sampling-based deep forest regression algorithm;high-dimension data;online soft measurement;difficult-to-measure parameters;complex industrial processes;deep learning;high-dimension datasets;high time cost;multisliced sampling-based DFR model;sub-forest;raw feature vector;mutual information feature selection model;optimized feature set;layer regression vector","","1","","22","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reliability of communication infrastructure is a top priority for network operators. To ensure reliable network operation, new design and management techniques for reliable communications must be constantly devised to respond to the rapid network and service evolution. As a recent and relevant example, deployments of 5G communication networks will soon enter their second phase, during which the network infrastructure will require upgrades to support new Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) services with availabilities of up to 6 nines to be guaranteed jointly with extremely low latencies. Even in the still preliminary vision of 6G communication networks, reliability is posed as one of the most critical requirements, as 6G networks will represent the communication platform of our future hyper-connected society, supporting essential services as smart mobility, e-health, and immersive environments with application in remote education and working, just to name a few. Similarly, disaster resiliency in communication networks is now attracting the attention of media, government and industry as never before (consider, e.g., the worldwide network traffic deluge to support remote working during the current Coronavirus pandemic). Luckily, several new technical directions can be leveraged to provide new solutions for network reliability as: increased network reconfigurability enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN); integration/convergence of multiple technologies (optical, wireless satellite, datacenter networks); enhanced forms of data/service replication, supported by, e.g., edge computing; network slicing, used to carve highly-reliable logical partitions of network, computing and storage resources. These, and many others, technological transformations can be leveraged to enable next-generation high-reliability networks.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3103145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9508355","Resilience;NFV;optical networks;wireless networks;network management;network design;critical services.","Resilience;Reliability;Optical fiber networks;5G mobile communication;Software;Reliability engineering;Safety","","","","","","0","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MNOs are making huge investments to setup 5G Networks with an anticipation of growth in their revenues. However, MNOs may not see the return of investment through end user consumer base alone and may need additional revenue streams. Thus, 5G system has been designed to have advanced built-in features such as network slicing and edge computing, considering requirements from enterprise segments or vertical industries including healthcare, automotive, smart factories, mission critical communications, etc. To enable more rapid deployment of vertical services, the 5G deployments require fostering innovation at the application layer. With the growing needs of verticals industries, the operators are now focusing on enabling standards for vertical applications in 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global standards forum for 5G.

This capability has opened the opportunity to new business models whereby infrastructure owners can monetize their investment by leasing resources to third parties (i.e. tenants). In this respect, a challenging task for the owner of the radio access network infrastructure (i.e. the network provider) is the spectrum planning of multi-tenant scenarios. This paper proposes different alternatives of hiring capacity to the provider as well as a set of spectrum planning strategies, each giving a certain degree of flexibility to allocate resources per tenant. These strategies are evaluated in a 5G small cell multi-tenant network through snapshot-based simulations.

To solve these problems, efficient management of airtime per station (STA) is necessary. In this work, we propose a scheduler to perform dynamic network slicing in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA. To evaluate the proposed scheduler, we consider a dynamic policy. Simulation results in a smart city scenario show that the dynamic policy is able to scale the network and satisfies QoS slice requirements.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417414","Foundation for Science and Technology; European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417414","Internet of Things (IoT);Network Slicing;IEEE 802.11ah;Airtime;Restricted Access Window (RAW);QoS;SDN.","Measurement;Smart cities;Network slicing;Simulation;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Virtual machining","Internet of Things;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication scheduling;virtual machines;wireless LAN","bandwidth limitations;radio access network;STA;IEEE 802.11ah Networks;virtualization technologies;QoS restriction;access point;AP;virtual machine;network metrics;QoS violations;Restricted Access Windows parameters;dynamic policy;QoS slice;airtime aware dynamic network;heterogeneous IoT services;efficient Quality;heterogeneous Internet;Things services;spectrum scarcity","","","","14","","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Communication in Industry 4.0 is one of the flagships and special applications of the 5G due to the specificity of the industrial environment as well as the variety of its services such as safety communication, robot's communications, and machine monitoring. In this context, we propose a new resource allocation for the future Industry 4.0 based on software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies, machine learning tools and the slicing paradigm where each slice of the network is dedicated to a category of services having similar QoS requirement level. In this article, the proposed solution ensures the allocation of the resources to the slices depending on their requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, and reliability. Toward this goal, our solution is performed in three main steps: first, Internet of Things (IoT) devices assignment to the slices step based on online Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm, second, inter-slices resources reservations step based on mini-batch gradient descent, and third, intra-slices resources allocations based on the max-utility algorithm. We have performed extensive simulations in a realistic industrial scenario using NS3 simulator.

The goal of this project is to develop a portable and low-cost system that can be used by untrained frontline health-workers for early detection of valvular heart abnormalities such as arrhythmias and murmurs. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud and Mobile, we simulated stethoscope-based cardiac auscultation typically done by trained doctors. We detect abnormal heartbeat patterns by applying pre-processing algorithms such as slicing and FFT to stethoscope sounds, converting into high-quality spectrograms and classifying with state-of-the-art Cloud-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained with normal and abnormal heart sounds. The system was trained and tested with heart sound datasets from UMichigan, Pascal and PhysioNet and 95% average classification accuracy was achieved. We optimized spectrogram parameters with experimentation for higher accuracy. The infrastructure can be extended to other diseases such as pulmonary disorders that can be detected via auscultation. The end-to-end system was successfully cross-validated with heart sounds collected in real-life with a low-cost digital stethoscope developed as part of the project, proving that it can be deployed as a holistic diagnostic tool to improve healthcare in developing countries and beyond.","","978-1-7281-2472-8","10.1109/CONECCT47791.2019.9012937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9012937","Healthcare;Heart Diseases;Cardiovascular;Artificial Intelligence;Cloud;CNN;Neural Networks;Mobile","Heart;Spectrogram;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Training;Time-frequency analysis;Stethoscope","artificial intelligence;bioacoustics;cardiology;cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;diseases;medical disorders;medical signal processing;mobile computing","artificial intelligence;valvular heart diseases;valvular heart abnormalities;arrhythmias;murmurs;cardiac auscultation;abnormal heartbeat patterns;high-quality spectrograms;convolutional neural network;normal heart sounds;abnormal heart sounds;heart sound datasets;low-cost digital stethoscope;FFT;pulmonary disorders","","","","20","","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network hypervisors are an in-between layer to allow multiple SDN controllers to share this control by slicing the network and giving each controller the power over a part of the network. This makes network hypervisors a critical component in terms of reliability and performance. At the same time, compute virtualization is ubiquitous and may not guarantee statically assigned resources to the network hypervisors. It is therefore important to understand the performance of network hypervisors in environments with varying compute resources. In this paper we propose an online machine learning pipeline to synthesize a performance model of a running hypervisor instance in the face of varying resources. The performance model allows precise estimations of the current capacity in terms of control message throughput without time-intensive offline benchmarks. We evaluate the pipeline in a virtual testbed with a popular network hypervisor implementation. The results show that the proposed pipeline is able to estimate the capacity of a hypervisor instance with a low error and furthermore is able to quickly detect and adapt to a change in available resources. By exploring the parameter space of the learning pipeline, we discuss its characteristics in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence time for different parameter choices and use cases. Although we evaluate the approach with network hypervisors, our work can be generalized to other latency-sensitive applications with similar characteristics and requirements as network hypervisors.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987462","","Virtual machine monitors;Adaptation models;Pipelines;Virtualization;Computational modeling;Radiation detectors;Estimation","computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;software defined networking;telecommunication control;virtualisation","network hypervisor performance models;software defined networking;SDN controller;logically centralized entity;real-time control;network forwarding state;network slicing;reliability;virtualization;online machine learning pipeline;control message throughput;virtual testbed;estimation accuracy;convergence time;latency-sensitive applications","","7","","23","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the findings from the initial analysis, we determine that the card is equipped with a “head and tail protection” mechanism. Second, a chosen-plaintext power analysis with a complexity of 2<sup>16</sup> is proposed, which is designed to recover the second round key from the power leakage in the third round. Then, a slicing-collision-algebraic attack is presented, which decreases the complexity to 2<sup>6</sup> rapidly. The experiments show that after collecting 20000 power traces (in approximately 200 s), only <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$2^{6} \times 8$ </tex-math></inline-formula> key guesses and another 177 searches (about 300 seconds) are sufficient in recovering the 56-bit source keys of DES successfully.

However, 5G slicing is attractive for infrastructure providers as long as they are able to generate revenues, while at once satisfying the tenants' competing and variable demands and coping with resources availability. This work proposes a flexible mechanism based on a multibidding scheme for 5G slice allocation. It is able to attain desirable fairness and efficiency figures in order to serve slice tenants and associated mobile users. Built on the notion of normalised Nash equilibrium, it is also provably overbookingfree even though the players' bids are oblivious to infrastructure resources constraints. Also, it is compatible with standard radio access schedulers used in modern mobile networks. Finally, a practical algorithm is proposed to drive the system to the socially-optimal operating point via an online procedure rooted on a primal-dual distributed algorithm.

There are ways to create 3D faces that are done manually using complex software but this also requires special skills, there are also other ways that use sophisticated methods such as artificial intelligent. However, both require a long time and process. In this study a simple method is applied, in the form of 2D face point mapping to 3D face point by utilizing linear equations that are built based on the Gauss elimination method. As a first step, two 2D face models and two 3D face models are correlated. Both are used as template for finding the basic formula, then the area of the two faces is normalized from 2D and 3D models into x and y coordinates so that they have the same area. Thus, each point of a 2D face model will have a correlation with the point of the 3D face model. Each x and y coordinate of the two models is at the same point, plus z-point information obtained from the 3D face model. Next, by slicing the 3D face model in the direction of the y-axis, you get a number of slices image of x and z axes. From each slice, several points are taken with coordination of x and z as a reference to determine the linear equation. With the Gauss elimination method, a linear equation can be built. After obtaining two models of linear equations for each slice derived from two different 3D models, a linear equation can be determined for the slices of the query model. The value obtained by a point in the query model, involving a comparison of colors between two adjacent points, is an interpolation of the two equations obtained. With the linear equation in each slice plane, a triangular face attribute can be built in a neater 3D model. In addition, you can also specify the number of vertices and faces. This is useful for modifying the 3D model. This research results in how to make 3D face models based on 2D face models more quickly, without training data. The results of this study can encourage the discovery of more template models that will increase the accuracy of the results obtained.","","978-1-7281-4449-8","10.1109/ELECSYM.2019.8901537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901537","3D face;slice image;linear equation;gauss elimination;vertices;faces","","face recognition","linear equation;3D face making;3D face point mapping model;2D face point mapping model;computer vision;Gauss elimination method;artificial intelligent;z-point information;query model;interpolation","","","","8","","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At software level, work so far has focused on measuring the energy consumption at function and application level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measure energy consumption at a feature level, cross-cutting multiple functions, classes and systems. We argue the importance of such measurement and the new insight it provides to non-traditional stakeholders such as service providers.

Not only the visual perception but also the algorithmic efficiency at outdoor environment vastly impacted due to adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, snow, etc. These weather conditions largely degrade video quality by inducing complex noise into video frames especially due to mutual motion between capture assembly/ camera and object/ scene of interest. This greatly hampers video analytics and computer vision in various real time applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart surveillance etc. Hence, restoring clean video from adverse effect of environment is one of the most important challenge in video analytics. With the aim of tackling this problem this paper proposes an efficient method of deraining videos by applying bilateral filtering on time-sliced video frames. The proposed idea exploited the strength of range-domain filtering possessed by bilateral filters and the spatio-temporal model of time-slicing. Extensive experimentation and their quantitative results indicate that our approach is reasonably effective in deraining video frames under different mutual motion between camera and object of interest in different rain density and is comparable to the state-of-the-art models existing in this domain and outperforms existing approaches with respect to performance time.","2640-074X","978-1-7281-0899-5","10.1109/ICIIP47207.2019.8985795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985795","bilateral image filtering;de-raining;optical flow;video restoration and enhancement","Videos;Rain;Cameras;Image restoration;Visual analytics;Dynamics;Information processing","computer vision;image filtering;image restoration;object detection;video signal processing","range-domain filtering;spatio-temporal correspondence;unconstrained environment;computer vision;outdoor video analytics;visual perception;algorithmic efficiency;outdoor environment;video quality;clean video;bilateral filtering;time-sliced video frames;bilateral filters;spatio-temporal model;time-slicing;mutual motion","","","","17","","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However these novel Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) necessitate increasingly complex monitoring and control schemes, which are commonly orchestrated by industrial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. As thousands of distributed field devices are involved in the operation of Critical Infrastructures, the enabling communication technologies need to fulfil exacting performance requirements as well as provide high levels of robustness, Quality of Service, flexibility and scalability. The ongoing evolution of cellular LTE (Long Term Evolution) towards 5G networks promises to meet all these specifications. In this context Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is set to play a crucial part within the mobile network's wired backhaul as well as core infrastructures and is thus included in many proposed 5G architectures. However, basic performance characteristics allowing a comparison of the two prevalent approaches to SDN, fully virtualised and hardware based Bare-Metal switching, are currently not widely available. Therefore this paper proposes a test-platform for the benchmarking of SDN as well as a prototypical architecture. The latter serves to facilitate the evolutionary development of LTE towards 5G for use in Critical Infrastructure communication in general and Smart Grids in particular. A comparative evaluation of switching performance, realized via the described testbed, is presented and an assessment is given. Based on the introduced architecture and testbed, future work will develop new mechanisms for end-to-end slicing as well as application aware scheduling.","","978-1-4673-9486-4","10.1109/NETSOFT.2016.7502484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502484","","Switches;5G mobile communication;Smart grids;Long Term Evolution;Performance evaluation;Computer architecture;Protocols","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;Long Term Evolution;software defined networking;telecommunication switching","virtualized switching;bare-metal switching;SDN-based 5G communication;critical infrastructure communication;smart grids;automated transportation systems;industrial supervisory control-and-data acquisition systems;industrial SCADA systems;distributed field devices;performance requirements;quality-of-service;cellular LTE;cellular Long Term Evolution;5G networks;software-defined networking;mobile network wired backhaul;core infrastructures;5G architectures;end-to-end slicing;application aware scheduling","","8","","19","","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, their analog nature of computing poses significant issues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear I-V characteristics of the memristor device etc. The non-idealities can have a detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy. To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. First, we perform extensive HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance combinations. Based on the obtained data, we train a neural network to learn the transfer characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional simulator which includes key architectural facets such as tiling, and bit-slicing to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx achieves low root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.25 and 0.7 for low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the GENIEx errors are 7× and 12.8× better than an analytical model which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate the degradation in classification accuracy by ≥ 10% on CIFAR-100 and 3.7% on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.","0738-100X","978-1-7281-1085-1","10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218688","","","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix multiplication;mean square error methods;memristors;neural nets;vectors","GENIEx;nonideal crossbar;linear nonidealities;memristive crossbars;memristive Xbars;neural networks;nondata-dependent models;HSPICE simulations;generalized approach to emulating non-ideality in memristive crossbars;root mean square errors;RMSE;matrix vector multiplication;MVM","","10","","27","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present a novel deep learning architecture, known as Temporal Tensor Transformation Network, which transforms the original multivariate time series into a higher order of tensor through the proposed Temporal-Slicing Stack Transformation. This yields a new representation of the original multivariate time series, which enables the convolution kernel to extract complex and non-linear features as well as variable interactional signals from a relatively large temporal region.

Many emerging services such as smart city, Industry 4.0, and autonomous driving are based on IoT devices and applications to collect and analyze data and control end devices (i.e., actuators). Among these services, several IoT applications, such as data analytics, need to be deployed at the edge to either reduce the latency to access data or treat the high amount of generated data locally. However, in the context of LoRa/LoRaWAN, most of the current IoT service deployments run the applications at a central cloud to ease the integration with existing software as a service (SaaS) platforms, without exploiting the benefits of edge computing. In this article, we propose a new framework that leverages the ETSI multi-access edge computing (MEC) model to deploy LoRabased IoT applications at the edge. In particular, the proposed model takes advantage of the ETSI MEC features, such as dynamic deployment of an IoT application at the edge and application life cycle management.

The era of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), and networked technologies have revolutionized the paradigm of healthcare. In the healthcare domain, digital images are a means by which sensitive information about the patients can be transferred wirelessly. Maintaining the confidentiality of these images requires designing a cryptosystem that is fast and sturdy. In this work, we present a fast chaos-based encryption scheme for medical images. The scheme employs a Logistic map, Chebyshev map, and Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM) for confusion and diffusion of the medical image. Initially, the image is circularly shifted, and subsequently, bit plane slicing is performed. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) plane is replaced with a plane formed by the XOR operation between the MSB and 7<sup>th</sup> ISB plane. The resultant image is scrambled using the Pseudo Random Number (PRN) generated by the Logistic map. The scheme is adaptive and calculates the image parameter like sum or mean to determine the initial condition for the PWLCM chaotic map. The PWLCM is used to generate a key image that is XORed with the scrambled image. Finally, a Chebyshev map is iterated and a PRN sequence is generated to permute the image pixels and obtain the final encrypted image. The cryptosystem has been evaluated for multiple types and sizes of medical images and on natural images as well. The average encryption time for an image of size 256×256 is 0.3287 seconds. The entropy is more than 99.70% and the correlation coefficient is close to zero for all the images. Simulation results validate that the cryptosystem has comparable performance with state-of-the-art schemes.","","978-1-6654-1450-0","10.1109/ICIEM51511.2021.9445362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445362","Image encryption;Chaotic systems;Medical Image security","Correlation coefficient;Chaotic communication;Medical services;Chebyshev approximation;Entropy;Encryption;Information and communication technology","chaos;cryptography;health care;iterative methods;medical image processing;random number generation","medical image;healthcare;digital images;fast chaos-based encryption scheme;logistic map;Chebyshev map;piecewise linear chaotic map;image parameter;PWLCM chaotic map;key image;scrambled image;image pixels;final encrypted image;natural images;fast image encryption framework;bit plane slicing;most significant bit plane","","","","17","","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, 5G slice networks should be as flexible as possible to accommodate different network dynamics such as user location and distribution, different slice use case QoS requirements, cell load, intra-cluster interference, delay bound, packet loss probability, and service level agreement (SLA) of mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). Motivated by this condition, this paper addresses a latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem for 5G slice networks in a multi-tenant, multi-tier heterogeneous environment, for efficient radio resource management. The latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem. The optimisation problem is transformed and the hierarchical decomposition technique is adopted to reduce the complexities in solving the optimisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent latency-aware resource allocation scheme (GI-LARE). We compare GI-LARE with the static slicing (SS) resource allocation; the spatial branch and bound-based scheme; and, an optimal resource allocation algorithm (ORA) via Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings reveal that GI-LARE outperformed these other schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988710","National Research Foundation, South Africa and Telkom, South Africa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072146","Network slicing;multi-tier;multi-tenancy;resource allocation","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics;Quality of service;Optimization;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;contracts;genetic algorithms;Monte Carlo methods;probability;quality of service;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;tree searching","MVNO;efficient radio resource management;maximum utility optimisation problem;hierarchical decomposition technique;genetic algorithm;intelligent latency-aware dynamic resource allocation scheme;GI-LARE;patial branch and bound-based scheme;Monte Carlo simulation;SLA;service level agreement;packet loss probability;delay bound;intra-cluster interference;cell load;OPEX;CAPEX;capital expenditure;network slicing-multitenancy scenario;multitier 5G network;optimal resource allocation algorithm;static slicing resource allocation;latency-aware resource allocation scheme;optimisation problem;multitier heterogeneous environment;mobile virtual network operators;QoS requirements;network dynamics;mobile network operators;operational expenditure;quality of service requirement;multitenant multitier heterogeneous network;5G slice networks","","8","","64","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It provides seamless services such as e-commerce, e-health, e-banking, etc., to the end users. These services are hosted on massive geodistributed data centers (DCs), which may be managed by different service providers. For faster response time, such a data explosion creates the need to expand DCs. So, to ease the load on DCs, some of the applications may be executed on the edge devices near to the proximity of the end users. However, such a multi-edge-cloud environment involves huge data migrations across the underlying network infrastructure, which may generate long migration delay and cost. Hence, in this paper, an efficient workload slicing scheme is proposed for handling data-intensive applications in multiedge-cloud environment using software-defined networks (SDN). To handle the inter-DC migrations efficiently, an SDN-based control scheme is presented, which provides energy-aware network traffic flow scheduling. Finally, a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is proposed to provide cost-effective inter-DC migrations.

In particular, the pervasiveness and high-density of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) at urban centers, together with their growing capacity and evolving standards, can be leveraged to support such demand.

This relates to performance indicators including network delay, data rate, reliability as well as security. To meet these criteria, 5G aims to provide network slices, i.e., virtually independent architectures on top of a single, unified communication infrastructure. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been identified as key technologies for implementing such a solution. This work utilizes these ingredients in conjunction for providing isolated end-to-end slices, from wireline cloud servers over the Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based Long Term Evolution (LTE) Radio Access Network (RAN) down to individual User Equipments (UEs). Thereby, a prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution is designed and implemented. The system enables independent management of each slice by either its respective owner or the ICT infrastructure operator. Also, resources are allocated dynamically to slice tenants in order of their priority. A comprehensive empirical evaluation based on real-world traffic patterns, such as Floating Car Data (FCD), is given. Hence, compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - crucial to stable operation of e.g., SGs - is demonstrated for up- and downlink traffic flows.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644145","","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;Network slicing;Quality of service;Control systems;Bridges;Software","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computer network reliability;file servers;Long Term Evolution;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","Network Function Virtualization;isolated end-to-end slices;ICT infrastructure operator;slice tenants;comprehensive empirical evaluation;SGs;Smart Grids;virtually independent architectures;single communication infrastructure;unified communication infrastructure;performance indicators;information and communication technology topologies;software-defined end-to-end network slicing;ICT topologies;Internet of Things;Industry 4.0;Vehicle-to-Everything;network delay;data rate;reliability;single unified communication infrastructure;NFV;SDN;wireline cloud servers;software-defined radio-based Long Term Evolution radio access network;SDR-based LTE RAN;prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution;resource allocation;real-world traffic patterns;service level agreements;user equipments","","11","","37","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach has not considered the scenarios where different slices require different PHY and MAC layers, for instance, for radically different services and for whole-stack research in wireless living labs where novel PHY and MAC layers need to be deployed concurrently with existing ones on the same physical infrastructure. To enable whole-stack slicing where different PHY and MAC layers may be deployed in different slices, we develop PV-RAN, the first open-source virtual RAN platform that enables the sharing of the same SDR physical resources across multiple slices. Through API Remoting, PV-RAN enables running paravirtualized instances of OpenAirInterface (OAI) at different slices without requiring modifying OAI source code. PV-RAN effectively leverages the inter-domain communication mechanisms of Xen to transport time-sensitive I/Q samples via shared memory, making the virtualization overhead in communication almost negligible. We conduct detailed performance benchmarking of PV-RAN and demonstrate its low overhead and high efficiency.

These sensors can operate in cloudy conditions ensuring ultra high resolution images while at the same time overcoming the limitations of satellite photography. In this paper we focus on just one such advanced payload application, namely, the segmentation of treecover / canopies over soil terrain. This task is mandatory in order to mask-out areas that are not of direct interest. The approaches studied are based on both supervised and unsupervised algorithms which take into account multi-spectral as well as synthetic features derived from the Digital Surface Model (DSM). We process the DSM by testing 2D convolution kernels together with a pseudo-random image slicing that tries to derive/model the ground/soil profile. Global thresholding is not able the segment tree / canopy area over the soil because the terrain slope is subject to significant change over small areas as is often seen to be the case with vineyards. The proposed approach takes into account such local variability to ensure a correct segmentation analysis in presence of slopes or other undulatory terrain variations.

Static assignment of wireless resources is creating bottleneck to the further development of emerging applications, including IoT and cyber-physical systems. Wireless network virtualization through slicing of primary wireless resources is regarded as an emerging approach for enhancing overall network performance to solve the bottleneck problem for those emerging applications. In this paper, we study wireless virtualization where a three-layer game is formulated for wireless infrastructure providers (WIPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), and IoT devices (or end users). In the proposed three-layer game, players play sequentially to find out their optimal strategies. With the help of a controller, WIPs divide and reconfigure their RF bands to sublease frequency slices to MVNOs based on their service-level-agreement. MVNOs let end users use their subleased frequency slices. For the game, we present a unique optimal solution that facilitates a tradeoff between quality of service of end users, payoffs of MVNOs and payoff of WIPs. We also present a necessary condition and closed form for the existence of an equilibrium in the game. Furthermore, performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results which show that the payoffs of WIPs and MVNOs are maximized while offering competitive price for the subleased RF spectrum for their users.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2874884","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1658972,CNS-1650831); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486622","Internet of Things (IoT);mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs);wireless infrastructure providers (WIPs);wireless virtualization","Wireless communication;Games;Virtualization;Internet of Things;Radio frequency;Quality of service;Base stations","cloud computing;game theory;Internet of Things;mobile computing;quality of service;virtualisation","three-layer game;wireless infrastructure providers;WIPs;mobile virtual network operators;MVNOs;IoT devices;end users;subleased frequency slices;payoff optimization;wireless network virtualization;IoT applications;three layer game approach;lightweight hand-held;primary wireless resources;network performance;service-level-agreement;quality of service;closed form;static assignment","","17","","22","","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the high dynamics of load distribution among different networks, simply optimizing the performance of individual network can hardly meet the demands from the dramatically increasing access devices, the consequent upsurge of data traffic, and dynamic user QoE (Quality-of-Experience). The deployment of smart networks, which are supported by SRA (Smart Resource Allocation) among different networks and CUA (Cognitive User Access) among different users, is deemed a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we propose a framework to transform HetNets to smart networks by leveraging WBD (Wireless Big Data), CR (Cognitive Radio) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) techniques. CR and NFV support resource slicing in spectrum, physical layers, and network layers, while WBD is used to design intelligent mechanisms for resource mapping and traffic prediction through powerful AI (Artificial Intelligence) methods. We analyze the characteristics of WBD and review possible AI methods to be utilized in smart networks. In particular, the potential of WBD is revealed through high level view on SRA, which intelligently maps radio and network resources to each network for meeting the dynamic traffic demand, as well as CUA, which allows mobile users to access the best available network with manageable cost, yet achieving target QoS (Quality-of-Service) or QoE.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0002-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932162","wireless big data;cognitive radio network;network function virtualization;software defined network;machine learning;smart radio allocation;cognitive user sccess","","","","","2","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

The continuous evolution of network technology and the digitization of the economy are key drivers for defining the expected 6G networks. Academia and industry have made tremendous strides during the past few years to shift the networking paradigm from human-centric communication to machine-type communication, and those gains will eventually lead to everything-type communication. Such developments have already enabled 5G systems to support massive connectivity, multigigabit data rates, massive multipleinput/ multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication, nonorthogonal multiple access, multiuser access, edge computing, dense wavelength division multiplexing for transport networks, service-based architectures, network slicing, network function virtualization, network automation, and core network encryption. Moreover, service requests are now processed using various sets of performance metrics in intelligent and self-healing fashions. Scaling these types of automated networks requires paradigm changes in communication network management, where communication and computation must ultimately fuse. Overall, this will lead to orders of magnitude of improved user satisfaction, and it eventually will spin out new, smaller domains for local and efficient service provisioning (e.g., private networks).

The 5G network is built on a service-based architecture (SBA) which enables programmability of the control plane of 5G Core (5GC) and supports network slicing (NS) in both core and access networks. NS enables the creation of multiple, isolated network slices tailored for specific services with diverse KPI objectives [1]. SBA of 5GC facilitates core network user plane functions (UPF) being deployed near the network edge, which has triggered intense interest in edge activities such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), whereas the traditional Self-Organizing Network (SON) functions are being enhanced continuously in 5G RAN. Meanwhile, the development of open and smart RAN led by an industry alliance, O-RAN, has received great attention.
