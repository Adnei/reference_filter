In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Particularly, in wireless networks, link bitrate depends on several factors (e.g., interference). In a wire-wireless network scenario, any mechanism that proposes to manage and allocate resources to implement slicing in wireless devices will require knowledge of the channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a Deep Learning algorithm to predict if a service provider will be able to fulfil a new network slice request given the conditions of the channel and the allocated resources.

However, achieving effective network slicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges, particularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the fast-changing network topology. By leveraging the widely deployed LTE infrastructures, we propose a semi-decentralized network slicing framework in this paper based on the C-V2X Mode-4 standard to provide customized network slices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial information of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying network situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each slice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB, each vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is realized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is a convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared to the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior knowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks. Furthermore, simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent network slicing scheme.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3109878","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9535371","V2V communication;C-V2X mode-4;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning.","Network slicing;Quality of service;Resource management;Sensors;Mathematical model;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Network slicing is recognized as a flagship technology that enables IIoT networks with multiservices and resource requirements by allowing the network-as-infrastructure transition to the network-as-service. Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents.

To efficiently use the resources, tenants can also lease their subscribers' terminals when idle to act as fog nodes augmenting the infrastructure and service capability of the InP. Our goal is to find an optimal slice request admission policy, which includes slices with augmented resources, to maximize the long-term revenue of the InP. A semi-Markov decision process is used to model the arrival of slice requests by taking into account the dynamics of users' demands and availability of resources. To find the optimal policy under uncertain resource demands, a Q-learning (Q-EFNS) algorithm is developed. Additionally, to improve the convergence time and reduce the computational complexity of Q-learning in large-scale scenarios, a Deep reinforcement learning (DQ-EFNS) algorithm and an enhancement based on a Deep Dueling (Dueling DQ-EFNS) algorithm are presented. Finally, simulation results show improvements in the range between 20% to 60% by our algorithms compared to conventional fixed network slicing when only 8% of the subscribers act as fog nodes. Besides, by using Dueling DQ-EFNS, the optimal slice request admission policy is obtained in just a few iterations.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322631","Dynamic resource allocation;edge/fog network slicing;deep Q-learning;dueling DQN","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Uncertainty","6G mobile communication;computer network management;deep learning (artificial intelligence);distributed processing;Markov processes;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","future 6G wireless networks;storage resources;semiMarkov decision process;optimal policy;dynamic edge network slicing;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;dynamic fog network slicing;computing resources;radio resources;infrastructure provider;unused resources lease back;subscriber terminals leasing;long-term revenue;Q-learning algorithm;DQ-EFNS algorithm;deep dueling algorithm;InP","","","","12","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, at a given time slot, the system makes online decisions on the request admission and scheduling, UAV dispatching, and resource slicing for different services. To characterize the impact of those parameters, we construct a time-averaged queue stability criteria by taking queue backlogs of all services into consideration, and formulate a system revenue function which incorporates the time-averaged system throughput and UAV dispatching cost. The objective is to maximize the system revenue while stabilizing the time-averaged queue, which falls into the scope of Lyapunov optimization theory. By bounding the drift-plus-penalty, the original problem can be decoupled into four independent subproblems, each of which is readily solved. The merits of our control framework are three-fold: 1) the system is able to admit and process as many requests as possible (i.e., maximizing the time-averaged throughput); 2) the time-averaged UAV dispatching cost is minimized; and 3) service queues are stabilized in the long-term. Extensive simulations are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the control framework can effectively achieve the system revenue maximization and queueing stabilization. Moreover, it can balance the trade-off among system throughput, UAV dispatching cost, and queueing states via parameter tuning. Compared with the fixed slicing, our dynamic slicing can react to the vehicular environment rapidly and achieve an average 26% of throughput improvement.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3070542","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002389,62001180,62072472,U19A2067); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706403); Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ2050); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18059); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Young Talents Plan of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2019RS2001); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council NSERC of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405488","Space-air-ground integrated vehicular network;dynamic slicing;isolated service provisioning.","Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Throughput;Dispatching;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Satellites;Network slicing","","","","1","","","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource reservation and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous virtual resource slicing framework for the next generation radio access network. The infrastructure provider periodically reserves the unused resource to the virtual networks based on their ratio of minimum resource requirements. Then, the virtual networks autonomously control their resource amount using deep reinforcement learning based on the average quality of service utility and resource utilization of users.

This problem is non-trivial in a dynamic, virtualized environment. In this paper, we first use stochastic network calculus (SNC) to study the end-to-end delay bound with given traffic demand and resources. Then, we propose a solution to find the amount of resources that should be allocated with given traffic distribution and end-to-end delay bound. Beyond that, we investigate the range of traffic demands that a network slice can support and design a learning-based dynamic network slice resizing strategy, which can significantly reduce overall resizing cost with quality-of-service guarantee.

However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by numerous variables. In this article, we investigate the reconfiguration within a core network slice with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This problem is also intractable by using conventional Deep Q Network (DQN), as it has a multi-dimensional discrete action space which is difficult to explore efficiently. To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose to exploit Branching Dueling Q-network which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. Based on the discrete BDQ network, we develop an intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm (INSRA).

This paper presents an online Deep Q-learning based network slicing technique that considers a sigmoid transformed Quality of Experience, price satisfaction, and spectral efficiency as the reward function for bandwidth allocation and slice selection to serve the network users. The Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) vertical use cases have been considered for the simulations which also deals with the problem of international roaming and diverse intra-use case requirement variations by using only three standard network service slices termed as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC), and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC).

This work provides an optimal and fast resource slicing solution under such dynamics by leveraging the latest advances in deep learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel system model which allows the network provider to effectively allocate its combinatorial resources, i.e., spectrum, computing, and storage, to various classes of users. To allocate resources to users while taking into account the dynamic demands of users and resources constraints of the network provider, we employ a semi-Markov decision process framework. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy for the network provider without requiring environment parameters, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is adopted. Although this algorithm can maximize the revenue of the network provider, its convergence to the optimal policy is particularly slow, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach using an advanced deep Q-learning technique, called deep dueling that can achieve the optimal policy at few thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can improve the long-term average return of the network provider up to 40% compared with other current approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761907","","Network slicing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;resource allocation","real-time network slicing;resource slicing solution;semiMarkov decision process framework;uncertain demand;time network slicing;advanced deep Q-learning technique;optimal policy;optimal resource allocation policy;combinatorial resources;uncertain customer demands;network resources;real-time dynamics;deep learning approach","","2","","18","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under traffic uncertainty, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by the numerous variables. In this paper, we investigate network slice reconfiguration with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address the curse of dimensionality of the problem, we propose to incorporate the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) into DRL, to avoid some unnecessary calculations of Q-value by separating the Q-network into a shared value branch and a number of distributed advantage branches. Furthermore, the value branch and the advantage branch of each dimension are aggregated to derive the corresponding dimension's sub-Q-value. Then the best reconfiguration action is composed of the subactions in individual dimensions which are selected by €-greedy policy. Finally, we design an intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy based on BDQ and extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed slice reconfiguration policy.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148848","","Resource management;Substrates;Bandwidth;Numerical models;Machine learning;Quality of service;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;branching dueling q-network;connectivity services;diverse usage scenarios;network slicing;dynamic network slice reconfiguration;intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy;reconfiguration action;advantage branch;distributed advantage branches;shared value branch;DRL;long-term resource consumption;extremely high computational complexity;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;network resource utilization","","1","","13","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This algorithm jointly considers the radio access network slices and core network slices to dynamically allocate resources to maximize the number of access users. First we build such a model, which is a mixed integer programming problem and it needs to be dynamically adjusted according to the changes of environment. We propose to use DQN algorithm to solve this problem, which can perceive changes in the environment and make dynamic decisions. Under each decision, we need to calculate the reward value of DQN, so we divide the problem into the core side and the access side. Then the dynamic knapsack algorithm and the link mapping algorithm are used to obtain the reward. The simulation results show that the average access rate of DQN scheme is higher than 97%.

Each node relies on harvested energy from the surrounding environment to provide computational services to local users. We propose the concept of dynamic network slicing, in which a regional orchestrator coordinates workload distribution among local fog nodes, providing partitions/slices of energy and computational resources to support a specific type of service with certain quality-of-service guarantees. The resources allocated to each slice can be dynamically adjusted according to service demands and energy availability. A stochastic overlapping coalition-formation game is developed to investigate the distributed cooperation and joint network slicing between fog nodes under randomly fluctuating energy harvesting and workload arrival processes. We observe that the overall processing capacity of the fog computing network can be improved by allowing fog nodes to maintain a belief function about the unknown state and the private information of other nodes. An algorithm based on a belief-state partially observable Markov decision process is proposed to achieve the optimal resource slicing structure among all fog nodes. We describe how to implement our proposed dynamic network slicing within the 3GPP network sharing architecture and evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the real base station (BS) location data of a real cellular system with over 200 BSs deployed in the city of Dublin.

Future access points (APs) are expected to have self-organizational capabilities, able to deal with large configuration spaces in order to dynamically configure each slice. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for network slicing in MEC systems, including slice request admission and a revenue model, to investigate the operator's revenue escalation problem while considering traffic variations. The revenue model is mainly composed of the longer-term revenue and short-term revenue. Particularly, we jointly optimize slice request admission in the long-term and resource allocation in the short-term to maximize the operator's average revenue. By employing the Lyapunov optimization technique, we develop an algorithm without requiring any prior-knowledge of traffic distributions, referred to as the DNSRA, to solve the problem. To reduce the computational complexity of directly solving the DNSRA, we decouple the optimization variables for efficient algorithm design. By this, the strategies for user association and CPU-cycle frequency are obtained in closed forms, respectively. Power allocation and subcarriers assignment are obtained by employing the successive convex approximation approach. Meanwhile, we develop a heuristic algorithm to obtain the dynamic slice request admission decision. Simulation results show that the proposed DNSRA can strike a flexible balance between the average revenue and the average delay, and can significantly increase the operator's revenue against existing schemes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2992607","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFE0126000); Key Program of NSFC-Tongyong Union Foundation(grant numbers:U1636209); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902292); Key Research and Development Programs of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY13-07,2019ZDLGY13-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901367); Beijing Wuzi University Youth Research Fund Project(grant numbers:2017XJQN07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087909","Mobile edge computing (MEC);network slicing;traffic variations;operator's revenue;resource allocation","Resource management;Mobile handsets;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization","approximation theory;computational complexity;convex programming;distributed processing;mobile computing;power aware computing;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","dynamic network slicing;resource allocation;mobile edge computing systems;resource slicing;power allocation;mobile devices;MEC systems;heuristic algorithm;slice request admission;energy scheduling;successive convex approximation;CPU-cycle frequency;dynamic slice request admission decision;computational complexity;DNSRA;Lyapunov optimization technique;longer-term revenue;revenue model","","10","","32","IEEE","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios. Simulation results showed that incorporating delay constraints has a significant impact on the performance, resulting in up to 10% and 4% reduction in terms of average resource utilization and acceptance ratios respectively.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541328","5G;delay;network slicing;resource allocation;SKM;quality of service","Delays;Resource management;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Routing;5G mobile communication;Substrates","","","","","","","","20 Sep 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Traditional model-based optimization or queueing theoretic modeling becomes intractable with the high reliability, and stringent bandwidth and latency requirements imposed by 5G.

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control.

In order to solve the complex requirements and provide customized services, a new network architecture is needed. To change the traditional control mode used in the traditional network architecture, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is proposed. First, SDN divides the network into the Control Plane and Data Plane and then delegates the network management authority to the controller of the control layer. This allows centralized control of connections of a large number of devices. Second, SDN can help realizing the network slicing in the aspect of network layer. With the network slicing technology proposed by 5G, it can cut the 5G network out of multiple virtual networks and each virtual network is to support the needs of diverse users. In this work, we design and develop a network slicing framework. The contributions of this article are two folds. First, through SDN technology, we develop to provide the corresponding end-to-end (E2E) network slicing for IoT applications with different requirements. Second, we develop a dynamic network slice resource scheduling and management method based on SDN to meet the services' requirements with time-varying characteristics.

Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput, computational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible, it is served with available communication and computational resources allocated over its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some of the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that can optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for network slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the network utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing requests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational constraints. Results show that reinforcement learning provides major improvements in the 5G network utility relative to myopic, random, and first come first served solutions.

Slicing divides a physical network into multiple dedicated logical networks to meet the requirements of diverse use cases. Efficient slice deployment algorithms are critical in reducing network operators' costs and energy consumption and in providing users better service. Many researchers have focused on static deployment when investigating network slices, effectively ignoring network operators' requirements for the dynamic deployment and expansion of such slices. In this paper, we first construct a joint optimization problem of cost and energy consumption. Then, we propose a prediction-assisted adaptive network slice expansion algorithm to deploy network slices dynamically. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts. First, we devise a Holt-Winters (HW) prediction algorithm to determine traffic demand for network slices. This method is intended to avoid frequent changes in network topology. Second, we propose a virtual network function (VNF) adaptive scaling strategy to reasonably determine the number of VNFs and resources required for network slices to avoid resource wastage. Finally, we develop a proactive online algorithm to deploy network slices. This method deploys network slices reasonably via the VNF deployment algorithm and link-routing algorithm to ensure slices' service requirements. Resource capacity and delay requirements are also considered in our evaluation to ensure that network costs and energy consumption are minimized. We then perform a series of simulation experiments to compare the proposed method's performance to state-of-the-art dynamic network slicing technologies.

VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics.

However, allocating bandwidth in a finer resolution usually implies larger action space, and unfortunately DQL fails to quickly converge in this case. In this letter, we introduce discrete normalized advantage functions (DNAF) into DQL, by separating the Q-value function as a state-value function term and an advantage term and exploiting a deterministic policy gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to avoid the unnecessary calculation of Q-value for every stateaction pair.

Its purpose is to dynamically and efficiently allocate resources for diversified services with distinct requirements over a common underlying physical infrastructure. Therein, demand-aware resource allocation is of significant importance to network slicing. In this paper, we consider a scenario that contains several slices in a radio access network with base stations that share the same physical resources (e.g., bandwidth or slots). We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem by considering the varying service demands as the environment state and the allocated resources as the environment action. In order to reduce the effects of the annoying randomness and noise embedded in the received service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio (SSR) and spectrum efficiency (SE), we primarily propose generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the action-value distribution driven by minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated action-value distribution and the target action-value distribution. We put forward a reward-clipping mechanism to stabilize GAN-DDQN training against the effects of widely-spanning utility values. Moreover, we further develop Dueling GAN-DDQN, which uses a specially designed dueling generator, to learn the action-value distribution by estimating the state-value distribution and the action advantage function. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed GAN-DDQN and Dueling GAN-DDQN algorithms through extensive simulations.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2959185","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1301003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701439,61731002); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019C01002,2019C03131); Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019LC0AB01); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY20F010016); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019QNA5010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931561","Network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;distributional reinforcement learning;generative adversarial network;GAN;5G","Resource management;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Mathematical model;Generative adversarial networks;Reinforcement learning;Generators","5G mobile communication;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","resource management;network slicing;5G communications system;demand-aware resource allocation;radio access network;physical resources;spectrum efficiency;estimated action-value distribution;service level agreement satisfaction ratio;generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network;GAN-powered deep distributional reinforcement learning;Dueling GAN-DDQN algorithms;GAN-DDQN training;target action-value distribution","","23","","48","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are heterogeneous structures and resource types between the subnets of the Fi-Wi network. This article considers the segmented application of network slicing technology in the optical backbone and hybrid access parts of Fi-Wi networks. In this way, the seamless connection of wired and wireless networks can be realized, and meanwhile adapt to the multiple network service forms and differentiated service quality requirements introduced in the 5G network era. In this article, we design a dynamic slicing (PDSM) scheme based on traffic prediction. This scheme includes all four procedures of service provisioning, which are network slice creation, traffic prediction, online reconfiguration of network slices and intra-slice routing, and resource allocation based on the prediction results. It is more flexible than the traditional static slicing scheme in the scenario, where the network state changes dynamically. We develop a prediction-based dynamic slicing algorithm (PD-MSRA) with intra-slice multi-path routing and shared resource allocation for the entire workflow of PDSM. We evaluate the performance of PD-MSRA on a variety of network topologies, and also implement several comparison algorithms including static slicing strategies.

One effective solution to overcome this challenge is network slicing, whereby different services could be supported by logically separated networks. To mitigate the increasing complexity of network slicing in 5G, we propose to leverage the recent advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies for automated network operation. Specifically, we propose intelligent network slicing architecture for V2X services, where network functions and multi-dimensional network resources are virtualized and assigned to different network slices. In achieving optimized slicing intelligently, several critical techniques, including mobile data collection and the design of an ML algorithm, are discussed to tackle the related challenges. Then, we develop a simulation platform to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent network slicing.

This paper models the handoff problem of end-to-end NS as a Markov decision process (MDP) maximizing the utility related to the UE's profit of being served, the handoff cost and the outage penalty. Both the states of the radio access network resources and the core network resources of each end-to-end NS are considered. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is adopted as the solution, and a double deep Q network (DQN) based NS handoff algorithm is designed.

This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and intercell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;quality of service;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling","model-based control;transfer learning;radio resource allocation;adaptive control strategy;heterogeneous quality of service;5th generation-beyond networks;next generation NodeB-level slicing;autonomic RAN slicing control;self-learning RAN slicing control;network slice;gNodeB-level;packet scheduling level slicing;network-level slicing;network conditions;slicing control performance;network resources;QoS requirements;radio access network;6G networks;5G networks;service provisioning;intelligent self-sustained RAN slicing framework","","2","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To achieve latency and throughput requirements of mobile users, it may be useful to migrate fog services in accordance with user movement - a scenario referred to as follow me cloud. The frequency of migration can be adapted based on the mobility pattern of a user. In such a scenario, the fog computing infrastructure should simultaneously accommodate users with different characteristics, both in terms of mobility (e.g., route and speed) and Quality of Service requirements (e.g., latency, throughput, and reliability). Migration performance may be improved by leveraging ""network slicing"", a capability available in Software Defined Networks with Network Function Virtualisation. In this work, we describe how we extended our simulator, called MobFogSim, to support dynamic network slicing and describe how MobFogSim can be used for capacity planning and service management for such mobile fog services. Moreover, we report an experimental evaluation of how dynamic network slicing impacts on container migration to support mobile users in a fog environment.

In this paper, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing method that flexibly allocates RAN resources using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In RANs, the number of slices controlled by a base station fluctuates in terms of user ingress and egress from the base station coverage area and service switching on the respective sets of user equipment. Therefore, when resource allocation depends on the number of slices, resources cannot be allocated when the number of slices changes. We consider a method that makes optimal-resource allocation independent of the number of slices. Resource allocation is optimized using DRL, which learns the best action for a state through trial and error. To achieve independence from the number of slices, we show a design for a model that manages resources on a one-slice-by-one-agent basis using Ape-X, which is a DRL method. In Ape-X, because agents can be employed in parallel, models that learn various environments can be generated through trial and error of multiple environments. In addition, we design a model that satisfies the slicing requirements without over-allocating resources. Based on this design, it is possible to optimally allocate resources independently of the number of slices by changing the number of agents. In the evaluation, we test multiple scenarios and show that the mean satisfaction of the slice requirements is approximately 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986050","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057705","Deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;RAN slicing;resource management","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Machine learning;Scalability;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication switching","flexible resource block allocation;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing method;RAN resources;optimal-resource allocation;one-slice-by-one-agent basis;fifth-generation mobile communications;RAN slicing method;Ape-X","","7","","34","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several baselines in terms of throughput and delay with low complexity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2900234","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374189,61620106011,61601097); Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile MCM(grant numbers:20160304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z011); Zhongshan City Project(grant numbers:180809162197874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644035","V-FRAN;Network Slicing;Cross Entropy;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Interference;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","entropy;Internet of Things;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;tree searching;vehicular ad hoc networks","resource allocation;slice scheduling algorithm;collaborative scheduling scheme;road traffic speed;release available IoV resource;heavy traffic load;modern transportation systems;intense information exchange;heterogeneous network traffic;complicated network environment;dynamic vehicle density;fog-radio access network;network slicing;maldistributed network traffic;available fog resources;weak resource utilization;smart slice scheduling scheme;vehicular fog radio access networks;network slices;smart network slicing;vehicular fog-RAN;Internet of Vehicles;Markov decision process;Monte Carlo tree search;metric cross entropy","","23","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider the problem of sequentially allocating fog node's limited resources to various IoT applications with heterogeneous latency needs. We formulate the problem as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), and present the optimal solution, known as the optimal policy, through dynamic programming.

Inspired by the definition and standardization of mobile networks, especially 5G that focused on business verticals, the term network slicing has received numerous state-of-the-art efforts to materialize an approach that meets dynamism, programmability, and flexibility requirements. Leveraged by SDN and NFV technologies, network slicing is inspiring by resource sharing similar to virtual machine management, allowing standard network hardware to accommodate a wide variety of logical networks with specific requirements and data and control planes. However, state-of-the-art approaches do not address resource slicing at the core of the network in detail and appropriately. Therefore, we built NASOR to provide network slicing over the Internet data plane spanning across multiple domains through a segment routing and a distributed-based approach. Our approach excels those found in state-of-the-art by delivering an open policy interface that allows third-party applications to manage network slices dynamically. In this sense, this paper exploits this interface through a mechanism of convolutional neural networks that classifies network traffic, instructing the path-setting agent to be aware of application which predominantly runs on the network improving dynamism in the network slices deployment.

There is an increasing demand for new services that require stringent constraints on capacity, latency and jitter to provide an appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) to end users. In order to cope with those requirements, network infrastructure needs to evolve from a static and closed architecture towards a more scalable, dynamic and agile one. SDN and NFV allows to provide different services, each one with its own QoS constraints, independent and secure, thanks to the network slicing concept, the main subject of this work. Network slicing allows to segment the underlying physical network into different logical networks to provide data transport customized to specific services.

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computationally-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (5GAuRA)(grant numbers:675806); Secretaria d’Universitats i Recerca del Departament d’Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2017 SGR 376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","19","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are two of the key enabler technologies in 5G networks that can be used to optimize the allocation of the network resources and guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications. As traditional model-based optimization techniques generally end up with NP-hard and strongly non-convex and nonlinear mathematical programming formulations, in this article, we introduce a model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the resource allocation problem in MEC-enabled IoV networks based on network slicing. Furthermore, the solution uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable better exploitation of the scarce channel resources. The considered problem addresses jointly the channel and power allocation, the slice selection, and the vehicle selection (vehicle grouping). We model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then we solve it using DRL with the well-known deep Q learning (DQL) algorithm.

To maximum the weighted-sum transmission rate performance under delay constraint, formulate a joint optimization problem of subchannel allocation and power control as an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. Based on the equivalent Bellman equation, the optimal control policy is first derived by the value iteration algorithm. However, the optimal policy suffers from the widely known curse-of-dimensionality problem. To address this problem, the linear value function approximation (approximate dynamic programming) is adopted. Then, the subchannel allocation Q-factor is decomposed into the per-slice Q-factor. Furthermore, the Q-factor and Lagrangian multipliers are updated by the use of an online stochastic learning algorithm.

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed service deployment algorithm achieves 100% in terms of both overall resource utilization and admission for higher priority slices in some scenarios in bandwidth-constrained contexts, which cannot be achieved by other existing schemes due to priority constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044951","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-108713RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294018","5G;network slicing;network services;quality of service;virtual network function;SKM","Quality of service;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Network slicing;Network topology;Routing","5G mobile communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","quality of service;QoS;network function virtualization technology;end-to-end network slices;intelligent resource allocation algorithms;network resources;NFV architecture;resource allocation strategy;resource utilization optimization;service deployment algorithm;priority slices;NFV aware network service;squatting-kicking model;5G mobile communication;SKM;intelligent Network slicing","","","","46","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we introduce in this paper statistical federated learning (SFL) provisioning models that can learn over a live network non independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets in an offline fashion while respecting slice-level service level agreement (SLA) long-term statistical constraints. Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Q-th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds. These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. Numerical results on various slice-level resources show that SFL enables SLA enforcement while significantly reducing the overhead compared to both state-of-the-art FedAvg and centralized constrained deep learning schemes.

In this paper, we investigate the realization approach of fog RAN slicing, where two network slice instances for hotspot and vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios are concerned and orchestrated. In particular, the framework for RAN slicing is formulated as an optimization problem of jointly tackling content caching and mode selection, in which the time-varying channel and unknown content popularity distribution are characterized. Due to the different users' demands and the limited resources, the complexity of original optimization problem is significant high, which makes traditional optimization approaches hard to be directly applied. To deal with this dilemma, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, whose core idea is that the cloud server makes proper decisions on the content caching and mode selection to maximize the reward performance under the dynamical channel state and cache status. The simulation results demonstrate the performance in terms of hit ratio and sum transmit rate can be significantly improved by the proposal.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.2965927","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003,61925101,61831002,61901044); State Major Science and Technology Special Project(grant numbers:2018ZX03001025,2018ZX033001023); 03 Special Project and 5G Program of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20192ABC03A041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:JQ18016); National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962338","Fog radio access network;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Computer architecture;Resource management;Radio access networks;Optimization","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;time-varying channels;wireless channels","vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios;5G;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;optimization problem;content popularity distribution;content caching;network slice;radio access network slicing;core network;fog-RAN slicing","","10","","44","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, 5G slice networks should be as flexible as possible to accommodate different network dynamics such as user location and distribution, different slice use case QoS requirements, cell load, intra-cluster interference, delay bound, packet loss probability, and service level agreement (SLA) of mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). Motivated by this condition, this paper addresses a latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem for 5G slice networks in a multi-tenant, multi-tier heterogeneous environment, for efficient radio resource management. The latency-aware dynamic resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximum utility optimisation problem. The optimisation problem is transformed and the hierarchical decomposition technique is adopted to reduce the complexities in solving the optimisation problem. Furthermore, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent latency-aware resource allocation scheme (GI-LARE).

In order to be independently managed by different players (tenants), slices need to be logically isolated from each other. As some of the applications envisioned for 5G networks are quite critical from performance point of view, a static slicing of resources, where isolation is not only logical but also physical, may appear a natural solution. However, the price to pay in terms of resource overprovisioning can be high, and therefore dynamic allocation strategies, based on optimized resource sharing, are alternative solutions. In this work, we propose an optimization framework to compare the two resource allocation schemes and define a metric to quantify the slicing gain. We show that the dynamic slicing outperforms the static approach and that the gain is significant even for stringent performance requirements, making dynamic slicing a viable solution also for critical applications.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014178","","Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Throughput;Quality of service;Measurement;Base stations","optimisation;program slicing;resource allocation","resource overprovisioning;dynamic allocation strategies;resource sharing;resource allocation schemes;slicing gain;dynamic slicing;dynamic network slicing;network resources abstraction;optimization framework","","1","","15","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Legacy models that aim at forecasting traffic demands fail to capture these key economic aspects of network operation. To close this gap, we present DeepCog, a deep neural network architecture inspired by advances in image processing and trained via a dedicated loss function. Unlike traditional traffic volume predictors, DeepCog returns a cost-aware capacity forecast, which can be directly used by operators to take short- and long-term reallocation decisions that maximize their revenues.

The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA.

Each communication request comes with quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward can be measured by the weight (priority) of this request. The accumulated reward over time should be maximized by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds a request generation algorithm through reinforcement learning that decides on how to craft fake requests to maximize the reward of fake requests over time, which in turn minimizes the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is more effective than other benchmark attacks such as generating random fake requests and fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement). Finally, we evaluate how the attack performance depends on system parameters such as the weight and the generation rate of fake requests, and the channel condition. Our results show that the flooding attack poses a major threat for network slicing in terms of starving 5G RAN resources and denying service to real network slicing requests.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473567","U.S. Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473567","","Weight measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Throughput;Quality of experience","","","","","","43","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Customized Slicing for 6G: Enforcing Artificial Intelligence on Resource Management","W. Guan; H. Zhang; V. C. M. Leung",NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Network","","2021","PP","99","1","8","Next generation wireless networks are expected to support diverse vertical industries and offer countless emerging use cases. To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","28","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, DUCA increases the number of granted users in the network, increases the fairness of resource allocation towards slices with large number of users and small user bandwidth demands. The slices with small number of users and large bandwidth demands have better fitting resource allocation to their requests increasing the efficiency.

In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform.

One of the major concerns in the RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge.

However, we observe that network requirements, such as latency and bandwidth, of tactile internet based cyber-physical systems or Tactile Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) are not static: they severely fluctuate over time. Therefore, for TCPS, static provisioning of network resources is sub-optimal. For optimal utilization of network resources, we propose a mechanism to, per TCPS flow, dynamically create, destroy and switch network slices, based on the network resources needed at that time. Our solution consists of two main components. First, we develop a clustering algorithm to determine the slices and their specifications required to support a TCPS flow.

However, proposed solutions are not particularly efficient due to the loss of pooling gains, and not very reliable due to variable channel conditions that with slice limited resources make performance not easily predictable. We propose a slice management framework where the shared resources are negotiated by tenants in a real-time market based on slice instantaneous demands. Our model, based on game theory, allows tenants to optimize their service strategies acquiring resources when and where it is necessary, according to the level of quality and reliability requested by the specific traffic types they handle. In this paper, we focus on modeling the game theoretical framework and on characterizing its equilibria in a multi-tenant scenario.","","978-1-7281-0270-2","10.1109/WoWMoM.2019.8792999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792999","","Resource management;Quality of service;Network slicing;Economics;Organizations;Dynamic scheduling;Games","5G mobile communication;computer network management;computer network reliability;game theory;network interfaces;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","network slicing negotiation;dynamic resource market;disruptive innovations;user-centric QoS paradigm;user groups;slice resource management;5G NR interface;pooling gains;variable channel conditions;slice management framework;shared resources;real-time market;slice instantaneous demands;service strategies;multitenant scenario;5G networks;aggregate performance handling;game theory;optimization;reliability;network traffic","","2","","21","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present paper, we address the problem of load balancing among multiple network service chains (which represent network slice instantiations of a Network Service Provider referring to a specific vertical application) originating from different Points of Presence (PoPs). For scalability reasons, we want to maintain the problem within an informationally decentralized setting, where each PoP has the knowledge of the aggregate workload generated by the slice users accessing through it, but not of that of the other PoPs (to avoid the exchange of information for control purposes). By taking also into account power consumption policies of the Infrastructure Provider, we find a set of candidate team-optimal solutions to this load-balancing problem, which are characterized by piecewise-linear functions, and compare their performance with that of other resource allocation strategies.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644472","Network Functions Virtualization;Network Slices;Load Balancing;Network Energy Efficiency;Team Decision Theory","5G mobile communication;Load management;Energy consumption;Servers;Resource management;Cloud computing;Containers","computer network reliability;resource allocation;virtualisation","virtualized environment;orchestration mechanisms;multiple network service chains;PoP;network service provider;virtual network slice instantiations;dynamic network slice instantiations;5G networks;dynamic resource orchestration;points of presence;power consumption;piecewise-linear functions;resource allocation strategies;decentralized scalable dynamic load balancing problem","","1","","21","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party.

In this new context, there is a growing need for new network resource allocation algorithms to capture such proposition. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a family of online algorithms with the aim to (i) minimize tenants spectrum allocation costs, (ii) maximize radio resource utilization and (iii) ensure that the service level agreements (SLAs) provided to tenants are satisfied.

This architecture consists in decoupling the baseband units (BBUs) from the remote radio heads (RRHs). The BBUs are pooled in the same centralized BBU pool, while the RRHs are distributed through different distant sites. Typically, the one-to-one logical mapping consists in assigning one BBU to one RRH so that distinct frames are generated for each RRH. Also, a logical mapping of one BBU to many RRHs could be established in order to deliver the same frames of a single BBU to a cluster of RRHs. Motivated by the network slicing concept, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy where the resource units (RUs) of each frame are partitioned in two slices. The first one constitutes the unshared slice and is allocated to the cell center users (CCUs) according to the one-to-one logical mapping. The second slice is constituted by a quantity of RUs shared by a cluster of RRHs that belong to the same BBU. This last common slice is transmitted according to the one-to-many mapping in order to be allocated to the cell edge users (CEUs) and to the mobile users (MUs). We also present a flexible solution that dynamically adjusts the BBU-RRH mapping scheme (i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many or hybrid) based on the radio resource usage of BBUs. On the one hand, our proposed solution achieves close packet delay to the one-to-one configuration, while providing lower power consumption and handover frequency. On the other hand, in comparison with the one-to-many configuration, our technique provides lower packet delay and subsequently better Quality of Service (QoS).","","978-1-5386-5633-4","10.1109/WD.2018.8361692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361692","Cloud-RAN;Wireless networks;Resource allocation;Scheduling","Computer architecture;Power demand;Throughput;Quality of service;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless communication;Handover","cellular radio;cloud computing;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication computing","cell center users;logical mapping;BBU-RRH mapping scheme;dynamic transmission strategy;cloud radio access networks;Cloud Radio Access Network;wireless networks;baseband units;remote radio heads;network slicing","","1","","11","","21 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture for multiple operators and cloud providers, with a new proof of business consensus protocol to ensure incentive and fairness.

Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic- aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low- priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloud-based radio access networks (CRANs).","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254593","","DNA;Resource management;Games;Delays;Radio access networks;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","5G;DNS system;traffic- aware resource allocation framework;FRAN;radio access network;tactile internet;flexible radio access","","8","","19","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, PN resource utilization can be improved by introducing advanced orchestration functionalities that can intelligently assign and redistribute resources among the slices of different tenants according to the temporal variation of the VN resource requirements. This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues. The benefits of dynamic slicing come at a cost in terms of service degradation (i.e., when not all the resources required by a VN can be provided), but the paper shows that the service degradation level introduced by the proposed solutions is very small.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000A77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273270","5G transport;Dynamic slicing;IP over WDM;Multi-tenant networks;Network virtualization;Software defined networking","Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Optical fibers","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;software defined networking","dynamic slicing approach;multitenant 5G transport networks;physical network resource utilization;orchestration functionality;software defined networking;network slicing;virtual networks;mixed integer linear programming formulations;heuristic algorithms","","28","","","","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we investigate a network slicing problem for the downlink RAN of a cellular network. Our target is the reduction of resource usage while guaranteeing slice isolation and simultaneously accounting for each slice's average rate and delay requirements. We tackle the problem with a Lyapunov optimization approach, leading to a simple resource assignment procedure that we can prove to achieve isolation while satisfying all slice guarantees. The proposed procedure leads to a functional split, where resources are scheduled within each slice by a slice manager, while a Software-Defined RAN (SD-RAN) controller dynamically re-assigns resources to each slice. We verify our approach through extensive simulations and provide insight on how to fine-tune available system parameters.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761163","","Throughput;Network slicing;Wireless communication;Optimization;Delays;Resource management;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;mobility management (mobile radio);optimisation;radio access networks;stochastic processes;telecommunication scheduling;wireless channels","radio access network;resource assignment procedure;software-defined RAN controller;downlink SD-RAN;dynamic RAN slicing optimisation;wireless channels;Lyapunov optimization approach;cellular network;network slicing problem;complex resource coupling;fixed-network side;network flexibility;programmable 5G networks","","9","","19","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, since extremely big data accesses among fast driving vehicles of unreliable V2X communications through both 5G contention-based random access interfaces: PC5 and sidelink V2X obviously increase contention collision probability, this clearly degrades the performance of delay, loss, and goodput. This paper thus proposes the approach of Dynamically Keeping reserved resource probability with flow traffic Steering (namely DKS) for platooning CACC and Emergency types of slicing in 5G. Two key contributions include: 1) dynamically determining the keeping reserved resource probability according to the collision probability and different priorities of flows and 2) dynamically steering 5G flow slicing for diverse ADAS applications, especially for platooning CACC, Emergency, etc. Evaluation results show that the proposed DKS approach outperforms the compared approaches in access collision probability, access delay, successful probability, goodput, the number of driving shockwaves, average vehicle velocity, and average travel time.","","978-1-7281-7198-2","10.1109/CACS50047.2020.9289794","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9289794","5G eV2X;5G Core Network;5G SideLink SPS;5G Flow Steering;MEC;Platooning CACC driving","5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Big Data;Delays;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle-to-everything;Numerical stability","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;cooperative communication;intelligent transportation systems;probability;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","access collision probability;5G sidelink SPS;5G cellular networking;contention collision probability;dynamic keeping reserved resource probability;slicing flow steering;platooning ADAS;autonomous self driving;ultrareliable communications;cellular vehicle-to-everything;C-V2X;cooperative intelligent transportation system;C-ITS;big data access;unreliable V2X communication;5G contention-based random access interface;flow traffic steering;platooning CACC;dynamically steering 5G flow slicing","","","","33","","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fulfilling these tasks is challenging since network infrastructure becomes increasingly complicated and heterogeneous. One promising solution is to leverage the great potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which has been explored to provide solutions ranging from channel prediction to autonomous network management, as well as network security. As of today, however, the state of the art of integrating AI into wireless networks is mainly limited to use a dedicated AI algorithm to tackle a specific problem. A unified framework that can make full use of AI capability to solve a wide variety of network problems is still an open issue.

Without NS, the 5G requirements in terms of flexibility, optimal resource utilization, and investment returns cannot materialize. Before slicing is commercially available, different sections of the 5G architecture should be modified to include NS. In this work, we present a novel dynamic radio access network slicing resource sharing method aimed to guarantee optimal service level agreements through the monitoring of each slice tenant's key performance indicators.

If each RA attempt is made by means of transmission of multiple consecutive preambles (codewords) picked from a subset of preambles, as proposed, collision probability can be significantly reduced. Selection of an optimal preamble set size can maximize RA success probability in the presence of a trade-off between codeword ambiguity and code collision probability, depending on load conditions. In light of this finding, this paper provides an adaptive algorithm, called Multi-preamble RA, to dynamically determine the preamble set size in different load conditions, using only the minimum necessary uplink resources. This provides high RA success probability, and makes it possible to isolate different network service classes by separating the whole preamble set into subsets each associated to a different service class; a technique that cannot be applied effectively in LTE due to increased collision probability. This motivates the idea that preamble allocation could be implemented as a virtual network function, called vPreamble, as part of a random access network slice. The parameters of a vPreamble instance can be configured and modified according to the load conditions of the service class it is associated to.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2800661","5G Innovation Centre, and EU SoftFIRE Project(grant numbers:687860); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276318","LTE;mobile networks;random access;network slicing;RACH;congestion reduction;analysis;simulations;coded random access","Long Term Evolution;Mobile computing;Uplink;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Performance evaluation","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;probability;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation","LTE;virtual network function;dynamic preamble subset allocation;RAN slicing;5g networks;random access mechanism;Long Term Evolution networks;RA attempt;multiple consecutive preambles;optimal preamble set size;code collision probability;minimum necessary uplink resources;high RA success probability;collision probability;load conditions;Multipreamble RA;codeword ambiguity;network service classes","","11","","52","","31 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, at a given time slot, the system makes online decisions on the request admission and scheduling, UAV dispatching, and resource slicing for different services. To characterize the impact of those parameters, we construct a time-averaged queue stability criteria by taking queue backlogs of all services into consideration, and formulate a system revenue function which incorporates the time-averaged system throughput and UAV dispatching cost. The objective is to maximize the system revenue while stabilizing the time-averaged queue, which can be achieved via the Lyapunov optimization theory. By bounding the drift-plus-penalty, the problem then can be decoupled into four independent subproblems, which are readily solved. The merits of our control framework are three-fold: 1) the system can admit and process as many requests as possible; 2) the time-averaged UAV dispatching cost is minimized; and 3) service queues can be stabilized over time. Extensive simulations are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the control framework can effectively achieve the system revenue maximization and queueing stabilization. Moreover, it can balance the trade-off among system throughput, UAV dispatching cost, and queueing states via parameter tuning.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-9484-4","10.1109/VTC2020-Fall49728.2020.9348488","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348488","space-air-ground integrated vehicular network;dynamic slicing;isolated service provisioning","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Throughput;Dynamic scheduling;Dispatching;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization;Tuning","Lyapunov methods;optimisation;queueing theory;scheduling","isolated service;Space-Air-Ground integrated Vehicular Network;given time slot;online decisions;request admission;scheduling;resource slicing;time-averaged queue stability criteria;queue backlogs;system revenue function;time-averaged system throughput;Lyapunov optimization theory;control framework;time-averaged UAV dispatching cost;system revenue maximization;queueing stabilization;queueing states;network resource;online control frame-work;SAG integrated Vehicular networks","","","","22","","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We envision that 5G NS can emerge as a game changer that accelerates the development of FMC while counterintuitively opening up opportunities for fixed operators and the like in need of higher access network capability by leveraging NS-assisted FMC. In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation.

Over this edge cloud, it is important to create optimal network slices to support different 5G verticals. Optimality is defined in terms of cost efficiency and QoS support. Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of mobile users in terms of mobile service consumption. In this paper, we present, on one hand, a tool for developing a spatio-temporal model of mobile service usage over a particular geographical area. This tool will help to define the behavior of mobile users in terms of mobility patterns and mobile service consumption. On the other hand, based on this tool, we present a benchmark of some interesting Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) placement algorithms, among them our enhanced version of the predictive placement strategy.

Resource slicing and scheduling are to allocate spectrum resources to different slices and determine user association and bandwidth allocation for individual vehicles. To accommodate the dynamic network conditions, we first formulate a joint resource slicing and scheduling (JRSS) problem to minimize the long-term system cost, including the DSS requirement violation cost, DTS delay cost, and slice reconfiguration cost. Since resource slicing and scheduling decisions are interdependent with different timescales, we decompose the JRSS problem into a large-timescale resource slicing subproblem and a small-timescale resource scheduling subproblem. We propose a two-layered reinforcement learning (RL)-based JRSS scheme to find the solutions to the subproblems. In the resource slicing layer, spectrum resources are pre-allocated to different slices via a proximal policy optimization-based RL algorithm. In the resource scheduling layer, spectrum resources in each slice are scheduled to individual vehicles based on dynamic network conditions and service requirements via matching-based algorithms. We conduct extensive trace-driven experiments to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system cost while satisfying service quality requirements.","2509-3312","","10.23919/JCIN.2021.9549118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9549118","space-terrestrial integrated vehicular networks;LEO satellite communication;resource slicing and scheduling;reinforcement learning;matching-based optimization","Satellites;Costs;Low earth orbit satellites;Dynamic scheduling;Delays;Quality of service;Job shop scheduling","","","","","","","","27 Sep 2021","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

Another challenge is the combinatorial optimization of numerous resources, e.g., radio, computing, and storage. This paper develops an optimal and fast real-time resource slicing framework that maximizes the long-term return of the network provider while taking into account the uncertainty of resource demands from tenants. Specifically, we first propose a novel system model that enables the network provider to effectively slice various types of resources to different classes of users under separate virtual slices. We then capture the real-time arrival of slice requests by a semi-Markov decision process. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy under the dynamics of slicing requests, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is often adopted in the literature. However, such an algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. This makes Q-learning practically inapplicable to our case, in which multiple resources are simultaneously optimized. To tackle it, we propose a novel network slicing approach with an advanced deep learning architecture, called deep dueling, that attains the optimal average reward much faster than the conventional Q-learning algorithm. This property is especially desirable to cope with the real-time resource requests and the dynamic demands of the users. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework yields up to 40% higher long-term average return while being few thousand times faster, compared with the state-of-the-art network slicing approaches.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666109","Network slicing;MDP;Q-learning;deep reinforcement learning;deep dueling;resource allocation","Network slicing;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;optimisation;resource allocation;virtualisation","deep dueling neural networks;network resource requests;combinatorial optimization;resource demands;semiMarkov decision process;optimal resource allocation policy;uncertain service time;optimal average reward;real-time resource requests;network provider;virtual slices;Q-learning algorithm;optimal resource slicing framework;network slicing approach;deep learning architecture","","27","","49","IEEE","12 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This chapter identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal‐level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.","","9781119723912","10.1002/9781119723950.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9536303.pdf&bkn=9536219&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Training data;Sensors","","","","","","","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Moreover, software defined network (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) empower this architecture to visualize the physical network resources. The network slicing identified as a multiple logical network, where each network slice dedicates as an end-to-end network and works independently with other slices on a common physical network resources. Most user devices have more than one smart wireless interfaces to connect to different radio access technologies (RATs) such as WiFi and LTE, thereby network operators utilize this facility to offload mobile data traffic. Therefore, it is important to enable a network slicing to manage different RATs on the same logical network as a way to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem and enables a slice to control its users' mobility across different access networks. In this paper, we propose a mobility management architecture based network slicing where each slice manages its users across heterogeneous radio access technologies such as WiFi, LTE and 5G networks. In this architecture, each slice has a different mobility demands and these demands are governed by a network slice configuration and service characteristics. Therefore, our mobility management architecture follows a modular approach where each slice has individual module to handle the mobility demands and enforce the slice policy for mobility management. The advantages of applying our proposed architecture include: i) Sharing network resources between different network slices; ii) creating logical platform to unify different RATs resources and allowing all slices to share them; iii) satisfying slice mobility demands.","","978-1-5386-5395-1","10.1109/WAINA.2018.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418082","5G Network;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution (LTE);WiFi;Software Defined Networking (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Mobility Management;IP Flow;Data offloading","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Computer architecture;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","mobility management architecture;efficient network connectivity;software defined network;multiple logical network;network slice dedicates;end-to-end network;common physical network resources;network operators;network slice configuration;service characteristics;RAT based network slicing;spectrum scarcity problem mitigation;heterogeneous radio access technologies","","3","","12","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As machine learning (ML) is expected to play a pivotal role in the efficient control and management of these networks, in this work, we examine the ML-based quality-of-transmission (QoT) estimation problem under the dynamic network slicing context, where each slice has to meet a different QoT requirement. Specifically, we examine ML-based QoT frameworks with the aim of finding QoT model/s that are fine-tuned according to the diverse QoT requirements. Centralized and distributed frameworks are examined and compared according to their model accuracy, routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) accuracy, and CPU (training time) and RAM (memory) requirements. We show that the distributed QoT models outperform the centralized QoT model in accuracy and CPU usage. The RSA accuracy, i.e., measuring the accuracy of the models with regard to the QoT-aware RSA decisions, is sufficiently high for both frameworks. Regarding the RAM usage, as the distributed framework has to train in parallel several QoT models, it may require higher memory, especially as the number of diverse QoT requirements increases. This memory, however, tends to be reserved for a shorter period of time. Moreover, this work develops a dynamic multi-slice QoT-aware (RSA) framework that integrates the ML-based QoT models. The aim is to examine the network performance when the diverse QoT models are considered, as opposed to the state-of-the-art single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach where all connections/slices are provisioned according to a single QoT requirement. We show that the multi-slice QoT-aware RSA approach significantly improves network performance, a clear indicator that the commonly considered single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach may lead to connection overprovisioning.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.387853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067831","","Estimation;Network slicing;Optical fiber networks;Solid modeling;Training;Random access memory","learning (artificial intelligence);optical fibre networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","decentralizing machine-learning-based QoT estimation;sliceable optical networks;machine learning;ML-based quality-of-transmission estimation problem;dynamic network slicing context;ML-based QoT frameworks;distributed frameworks;model accuracy;RAM requirements;distributed QoT models;centralized QoT model;RSA accuracy;QoT-aware RSA decisions;distributed framework;parallel several QoT models;multislice QoT-aware framework;ML-based QoT models;network performance;diverse QoT models;single QoT requirement;multislice QoT-aware RSA;single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach;diverse QoT requirements;5G diverse use cases","","3","","","","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this new context, how to correctly handle resource allocation among tenants and how to maximize the monetization of the infrastructure become fundamental problems that need to be solved. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a network slice admission control algorithm that (i) autonomously learns the best acceptance policy while (ii) it ensures that the service guarantees provided to tenants are always satisfied.

Deploying different network slice types requires the global view of the network and the automated orchestration and management of the underlying resources. This is facilitated by utilizing software-defined networking and network function virtualization as the 5G key-enabler technologies. In this paper, we propose a practical network slicing resource management scheme which is comprised of a dynamic, priority-based resource allocation cooperating with an admission control unit. Adopting the proposed dynamic resource allocation would allow the admission control to comply with more NS requests while ensuring the desired requirements of the existing network slices. To validate the effectiveness of such a mechanism in a real environment, we take advantage of the features provided by OpenAirInterface and FlexRAN to efficiently manage multiple isolated network slices. In particular, we evaluate the significance of the network slicing, the isolation degree among created slices, and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through several practical scenarios.","","978-1-6654-1241-4","10.1109/CSICC52343.2021.9420609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420609","Network Slicing;5G;Dynamic resource management;Admission control","5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Admission control;Prototypes;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling;Network function virtualization","5G mobile communication;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;virtualisation","practical resource management prototype;mobile networks;mobile operators;automated orchestration;software-defined networking;5G key-enabler technologies;dynamic priority-based resource allocation;multiple isolated network slices;admission control unit;network slicing resource management scheme;OpenAirInterface;FlexRAN;network function virtualization","","","","22","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many 5G use cases, network requirements vary over time and CSPs must dynamically adapt network slices to satisfy the contractual network slice QoS, cooperating and using each others’ resources, e.g. when resources of a single CSP are not sufficient or suitable to maintain all it’s current SLAs. While this need for dynamic cross-CSP cooperation is widely recognized, realization of this need is not yet possible due to gaps both in business processes and in technical capabilities.In this paper, we present a 5GZORRO approach to dynamic cross-CSP slice scaling. Our approach both enables CSPs to collaborate, providing security and trust with smart multi-party contracts, and facilitates thus achieved collaboration to enable resource sharing across multiple administrative domains, either during slice establishment or when already existing slice needs to expand or shrink. Our approach allows automating both business and technical processes involved in dynamic lifecycle management of cross-CSP network slices, following ETSI’s Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) closed-loop architecture, and relying on resource-sharing Marketplace, Distributed Ledger (DL), and Operational Data Lake.

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. We then evaluate each class of algorithms in terms of accuracy, sample complexity, and model explainability. Our experiments reveal that, in terms of these three requirements, the gradient boosting and neural network algorithms for SLA decomposition out-perform random forest algorithms, given emulated data sets.","","978-1-7281-5684-2","10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165317","Network slicing;E2E orchestration;SLA;random forest;gradient boosting;neural networks","Machine learning;Network slicing;Data models;Training;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Quality of service","augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;random forests;supervised learning","mobile networks;core networks;total SLA budget;network service operators;SLA decomposition planner;network slicing;supervised machine learning algorithms;neural network algorithms;end-to-end slice SLA decomposition;network service industry;industrial automation;augmented reality;virtual reality","","","","26","","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as nowadays networks are increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and large-dimensioned. This contradicts the dominant network slicing solutions that only customize immediate performance over one snapshot of the system in the literature. Instead, this paper first presents a two-stage slicing optimization model with time-averaged metrics to safeguard the network slicing in the dynamical networks, where prior environmental knowledge is absent but can be partially observed at runtime. Directly solving an off-line solution to this problem is intractable since the future system realizations are unknown before decisions. Therefore, we propose a learning augmented optimization approach with deep learning and Lyapunov stability theories. This enables the system to learn a safe slicing solution from both historical records and run-time observations. We prove that the proposed solution is always feasible and nearly optimal, up to a constant additive factor. Finally, we demonstrate up to 2.6× improvement in the simulation when compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.2999696","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Project(grant numbers:EP/R030863/1); China Scholarship Council for the study at the University of Exeter; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9107260","Network slicing;5G;deep learning;Lyapunov optimization","Optimization;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Deep learning;Stochastic processes;Knowledge engineering;Computational modeling","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;optimisation;telecommunication computing","Lyapunov stability theories;5G enabling technology;deep learning;off-line solution;dynamical networks;time-averaged metrics;two-stage slicing optimization model;learning augmented optimization approach;safeguard network slicing","","7","","47","IEEE","3 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though network slicing promises the provision of services on demand, many of its use cases, such as self-driving cars and Google's Stadia, would require the integration of a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) platform in 5G networks.

We investigate MEC and network slicing for the provision of 5G service focused use cases. Recently, changes to the cloud-native 5G core are a focus with MEC use cases providing network scalability, elasticity, flexibility, and automation. A cloud-native microservices architecture, along with its potential use cases for 5G network slicing, is envisioned.

Technologies, such as multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are being researched to support various vertical use cases. However, simply utilizing network slicing and MEC is insufficient when providing a specific IoT service. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of arranging and operating common service functions (CSFs) used in the IoT platform at the edge of the network. In addition, it is necessary not only to deliver virtual CSFs but also to implement autoscaling policies of these virtual common service resources. This study extends the idea of resource slicing technologies for the IoT service layer. The IoT service layer exposes the virtual IoT CSFs as an IoT slice service to be provided in the form of virtual network functions (VNFs) with MEC applications on top of the network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) at the edge of the network. We propose a framework architecture for virtual IoT slice service orchestration, and illustrate how to instantiate the virtual IoT service functions in the existing centralized cloud to the MEC platform.

The effective realization of SaaS approaches introduces a dynamic resource allocation problem, manifested as challenging run-time decisions upon on-demand slice part requests. The Orchestrator is hence responsible to perform an optimized decision on-the-fly on which elasticity requests to address based on an orchestration policy defined within the context of Network Slice architecture for the followed revenue model. This paper presents a slice management strategy for such an orchestrator can follow, based on reinforcement learning, able to efficiently orchestrate slice elasticity requests to comprehend the maximum revenue for the stakeholders of end-to-end network slice lifecycle.

To this end, we design and implement, in this paper, an SDN based architecture for end-to-end network slicing which proactively and dynamically adapts radio slices to the transport network slices. The developed architecture enables the creation, modification and continuity of radio and transport network slices while considering their resource and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. It leverages Machine Learning for predicting radio slices capacities, improving network resource utilization, and predicting congestion within each network slice.

Specifically, to capture the small-timescale network dynamics, a computing task scheduling problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization program, for maximizing the long-term network-wide computation load balancing with minimum task offloading variations.

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience. To validate our approach, we evaluate the agent under different configurations and in real-world settings and present the results.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3074618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409935","5G and beyond;Service Function Chain;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Multi-access Edge Computing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Management and Orchestration.","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Channel allocation;Servers;Resource management","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-2522-0","10.1109/NCA.2019.8935064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935064","Network Slicing;IEEE 802.11ah;Restricted Access Window (RAW);Quality of Service (QoS);Software Defined Networks (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Radio Access Technologies (RATs)","Network slicing;Quality of service;Software;Network function virtualization;Measurement;Hardware;Standards","application program interfaces;quality of service;radio access networks;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication control;virtualisation;wireless LAN","wireless network infrastructure;IEEE 802.11ah Networks;virtual network function;software defined network controller;IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point;slicing templates;neighbor slices;virtual network slicing broker","","2","","13","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their promise lies in enabling tenants (such as mobile operators and/or services) to reap the cost and performance benefits of sharing resources while retaining the ability to customize their own allocations. When employing dynamic sharing mechanisms, tenants may exhibit strategic behavior, optimizing their choices in response to those of other tenants. This paper analyzes dynamic sharing in network slicing when tenants support inelastic users with minimum rate requirements. We propose a NEtwork Slicing (NES) framework combining: 1) admission control; 2) resource allocation; and 3) user dropping. We model the network slicing system with admitted users as a NES game; this is a new class of game where the inelastic nature of the traffic may lead to dropping users whose requirements cannot be met. We show that, as long as admission control guarantees that slices can satisfy the rate requirements of all their users, this game possesses a Nash equilibrium. Admission control policies (a conservative and an aggressive one) are considered, along with a resource allocation scheme and a user dropping algorithm, geared at maintaining the system in Nash equilibria. We analyze our NES framework's performance in equilibrium, showing that it achieves the same or better utility than static resource partitioning, and bound the difference between NES and the socially optimal performance.

Moreover, the data analytics in 5G mobile network can be seen as a robust solution to transform the challenging features of 5G into a reality. So, for that, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has been introduced a network data analytics function (NWDAF) in 5G service-based architecture (SBA). NWDAF collects the data from different core and management domains and performs analytics on that historical data. It also enables the network operators (NOs) to train their Machine Learning (ML) techniques and use various third-party solutions. On the other side, the automation and management of the end - to-end (e2e) network slicing in a multi -domain environment is a critical task. Therefore, in this manuscript, we have designed a closed-loop Intent-based Networking (IBN) platform, which automatically ensures the commissioning, activation, run-time monitoring, and decommissioning of the network slices. Moreover, we have integrated the newly introduced 3GPP NWDAF with the IBN platform for efficient e2e network slice lifecycle management. By implementing different ML models in the NWDAF function, we can predict the slice load, user mobility, traffic forecasts, and anomaly detection from the network slices.","2576-8565","978-4-88552-332-8","10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562662","E2E Network Slicing;Slice LCM;5G Networks;OSM;FlexRAN;NWDAF","","","","","","","26","","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose to formulate this challenge as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem in which each BS represents an agent.

In particular, 5G network slicing, which allows a physical infrastructure to split into multiple logical networks, keeps the balance of network resource allocation among different service types with on-demand resource requests. However, achieving effective resource allocation across the end-to-end network is difficult due to the dynamic characteristics of slicing requests such as uncertain real-time resource demand and heterogeneous requirements. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic resource allocation framework for end-to-end network slicing with heterogeneous requirements in multi-layer MEC environments. We first design a hierarchical MEC architecture and formulate a resource allocation problem for the end-to-end network slicing as an optimization problem using the Markov decision process (MDP). Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), we develop independently-collaborative and jointly-collaborative dynamic resource allocation algorithms to maximize resource efficiency while satisfying the QoS of slices.

In network slicing, dynamic resource orchestration and network slice management are critical for resource efficiency. However, it is highly complicated such that the traditional approaches can not effectively perform resource orchestration due to the lack of accurate models and hidden problem structures. To address this challenge, we propose a constrained reinforcement learning based approach for network slicing.

Network slicing allows the operation of multiple end-to-end logical networks on a common physical infrastructure: each network slice is tailored to best support a specific service. Network slicing on the radio access network (RAN) domain is challenging. In order to manage the scarce radio resources, RAN slicing requires flexibility, efficient resource sharing, and customization. Hence, dynamic resource management presents unique challenges, it has to take into account different issues that can also be in contrast with each other. This paper proposes a two-layer scheduler for an efficient and low complexity RAN slicing approach in actual systems.

It enables one to cost effectively customize logical networks over a shared infrastructure. A critical component of network slicing is resource allocation, which needs to ensure that slices receive the resources needed to support their services while optimizing network efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice Efficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a constrained resource allocation game, where (i) slices unilaterally optimize their allocations to best meet their (dynamic) customer loads, while (ii) constraints are imposed to guarantee that, if they wish so, slices receive a pre-agreed share of the network resources. The resulting game is a variation of the well-known Fisher market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for network resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher market) prices are constrained for some resources to provide the desired guarantees. In this way, GREET combines the advantages of a share-based approach (high efficiency by flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones (which provide guarantees by assigning a fixed amount of resources). We characterize the Nash equilibrium, best response dynamics, and propose a practical slice strategy with provable convergence properties. Extensive simulations exhibit substantial improvements over network slicing state-of-the-art benchmarks.","","978-3-903176-29-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155326","","Resource management;Base stations;Network slicing;Games;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics;Nash equilibrium","game theory;quality of service;resource allocation","network slicing games;service guarantees;network efficiency;logical networks;Guaranteed seRvice Efficient nETwork slicing;constrained resource allocation game;network resources;Fisher market;desired guarantees;share-based approach;practical slice strategy;network slicing state-of-the-art benchmarks","","","","38","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take the full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node, where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conducted an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides twice as much transmission speed as that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3052498","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Fast Intelligence Analysis HW/SW Engine Exploiting IoT Platform for Boosting On-device AI in 5G Environment)(grant numbers:2020-0-00959); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328448","Internet of Things (IoT);multiaccess edge computing (MEC);network slicing;oneM2M standard;virtualization","Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Network slicing;Computer architecture;Edge computing;5G mobile communication","","","","","","72","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","5G mobile communication;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;quality of service;regression analysis;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics);virtualisation","knapsack problems;admission control;recursive optimization;regression trees;OAI;open air interface;network infrastructure resources;mobile operators;5G network slices;slicing decision;machine learning;static slicing;ML based approaches;5G experimental prototype;slice scheduler modules;resource pool;physical resources;optimum slice;network resources;dynamic slicing approach;physical network;logical virtual networks;shared network infrastructure;heterogeneous demands;resource orchestration;ML based approach;uninformed random slicing-decisions","","6","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new intelligent control for active and passive learning in the integrated semantic space works in a semantic space that is dynamically formed by the combinations of meaning space attained from the semantic associative calculation and the learned visual feature space derived by deep learning over the media data. Our model is inspired by the human ability to understand the semantic meaning of information by using active and passive learning. To get the query image results with similar semantic meaning, we define two types of knowledge representations: known and unknown semantic. Known semantic, is a set of the comprehensive concepts of meaning that is embedded in the system and used for the semantic associative calculation to construct the meaning space. We associate it with the passive learning. On the other hand, the unknown semantic knowledge is a set of comprehensive concepts of meaning that is not discovered in the system and has to be sought from the pattern of media through statistic and/or learned patterns. This deep active learning can be associated with the active human learning. We describe how the system chooses the subspace from the semantic space through the intelligent control for active and passive learning in the integrated semantic space by slicing, dicing and pivoting dimensions to identify and retrieve the meaning of images. The proposed system is an experimental modular model for database developed to answer the given semantic query in which the axis is represented in the columnar model database.

However, as the dynamic traffic demands and the mobility in vehicular networks, how to perform RAN slicing efficiently to provide stable quality of service (QoS) for connected vehicles is still a challenge. In order to meet the diversified service request of vehicles in such a dynamic vehicular environment, in this paper, we propose a two-timescale radio resource allocation scheme, namely, LSTM-DDPG, to provide stable service for vehicles. Specifically, for the long-term dynamic characteristics of service request from vehicles, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) to follow the tracks, such that the dedicated resource allocation is executed in a long timescale by using historical data. On the other hand, for the impacts of channel changes caused by high-speed movement in a short period, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is leveraged to adjust the allocated resources. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-DDPG with simulation results, the cumulative probability that the slice supplies a stable performance to the served vehicle within the resource scheduling interval can reach more than 90%.

This is achieved by deploying several, virtually dedicated networks, known as slices, on top of a unified, physical communication infrastructure. While various solutions have been presented for Core Network Slicing, the here presented approach aims to provide an end-to-end solution by allocating Radio Access Network (RAN) resources, realizing slicing for mission-critical applications via a novel scheduler design. A proof of concept is provided by way of detailed empirical evaluations, based on IoT scenarios from the energy sector (i.e., Smart Grids).

Considering versatile users' quality of service (QoS) requirements on transmission delay and rate, coarse resource provisioning scheme and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous slicing refinement algorithm are proposed. Then, a shape-based heuristic algorithm for user resource customization is devised to improve resource utilization and QoS satisfaction. In principle, the DQN algorithm allocates only the necessary resource to slices to satisfy users' QoS requirements. For fairness in comparison, we reserve all the unused resources back to the slices. In case there is a sudden change in user population in one slice, the algorithm provides isolation. To validate the advantage, system-level simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm balances the satisfaction up to about 100% and resource utilization up to 80% against state-of-the-art solutions.

Network slicing facilitates a cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure such that each network is customized to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g., mobile broadband, Internet of Things applications) and/or communications service providers (e.g., special purpose service providers for different sectors such as public safety, utilities, smart city, and automobiles). Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment of radio resources and the degrees of isolation and customization.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2017.1600220WC","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891795","","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Planning;Interference;Computer architecture;Communication channels","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication services;wireless channels","radio access network;radio resource management perspective;network slicing;future 5G networks;future application scenarios;multiple logical networks;common physical network infrastructure;communications service providers;special purpose service providers;radio channel;RAN slicing problem;multicell network;RRM functionalities;RAN slicing approaches","","61","","15","","4 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

As the 5G standard matures and is put into commercial use, the green interconnected 5G mobile network has shown great potential. With 5G network slicing technology, a wireless private network can be virtualized for each industry to better meet the requirements of smart grid security, reliability and flexibility. Considering the differentiated service characteristics of the smart grid and the challenges of flexibility and adaptability of the communication platform, this paper aims to solve the resource allocation problem of the radio access network (RAN) slice of smart grid. Since the type of service arrival of smart grid is unknown and lacks prior knowledge, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to conduct this research. The mapping from the RAN slice resource management to DRL of the smart grid is analyzed at first, and then discussion from the elastic application and the real-time application is presented. Furthermore, a smart grid RAN slice allocation strategy based on DRL is proposed.

The physical layer of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) is the weakest layer in the network as anyone can access the optical cables from any location and states his attack. To overcome this thread a security layer is proposed to be added during the mapping processes of OTN frames. The automatic detection of any intrusion is done by monitoring the variations of the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) by using intelligent software-defined networks (SDN). For the first time the paper shows the role of the machine learning (ML) techniques in the multi-failure restorations of the optical transport network, and a new model is introduced by slicing the multi-domains to 3 layers to fit the needs of 5G at the same time all these domains are managed by only one centralized intelligent controller. The results show that using intelligent techniques such as artificial intelligence in the provisioning of optical transport network could improve the multi-failure restoration from 25% to 100%, the revenue from some OTN domains could be increased by 50%, the switching time could be enhanced by 50%, the latency could be reduced from 27 msec to 742 musec, and it will take many years to figure out the right keys to perform the decryption process from any intruder.","","978-1-7281-8226-1","10.1109/NILES50944.2020.9257917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9257917","Optical Transport Network (OTN);Optical to Signal Network Ratio (OSNR);wiretapping;Multi-Failure;Service restorations;machine learning technology;centralized controller;Signal Cryptographic","Adaptive optics;Optical fibers;Optical network units;Security;Cryptography;Optical polarization;Physical layer","client-server systems;computer network management;computer network reliability;computer network security;intelligent control;optical fibre networks;software defined networking;telecommunication control","smart security model;optical network;artificial intelligence;client signals;physical layer;optical transport network;weakest layer;optical cables;security layer;optical signal;intelligent software-defined networks;multifailure restoration;centralized intelligent controller","","","","23","","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, managing RAN resources and sharing them among network slices is an increasingly difficult task, which needs to be properly designed. The goal is to improve network performance and introduce flexibility and greater utilization of network resources by accurately and dynamically provisioning the activated network slices with the appropriate amounts of resources to meet their diverse requirements. In this paper, we propose a data-driven RAN slicing mechanism based on a resource sharing algorithm running at the Slice Orchestrator (SO) level. This algorithm computes the necessary radio resources to be used by each deployed network slice. These resources are adjusted periodically based on current estimates of achievable throughput performance derived from channel quality information, and in particular from the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values of the users of each network slice retrieved from the RAN. CQI information is reported to base stations by the User Equipment (UE) following standard procedures, but extracting and frequently reporting it from base stations to the SO may result in significant communication overhead. To mitigate this overhead while maintaining at the SO level an accurate view of UE channel qualities, we propose a machine learning approach to infer the stability of UE channel conditions, as well as predictive schemes to reduce the CQI reporting intensity based on the inferred channel status. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of our data-driven RAN slicing framework, which allows to meet the stringent requirements of two main classes of network slices in 5G, i.e., enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3098193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490293","Network slicing;radio resource sharing;RAN monitoring;CQI;machine learning.","Resource management;Monitoring;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Base stations;5G mobile communication;Channel estimation;Radio access networks","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture and operation of the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), the building block of asynchronous TSN. Next, a management framework based on ETSI Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) and Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) reference models is presented for enabling the TSN transport network slicing and its interworking with Fifth Generation (5G) for backhauling. Then we cover the flow allocation problem in asynchronous TSNs and the importance of Machine Learning techniques for assisting it. Last, we present a simulation-based proof-of-concept (PoC) to assess the capacity of ATS-based forwarding planes for accommodating 5G data flows.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373015","","5G mobile communication;Logic gates;Resource management;Regulation;Substrates;Bridges;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Machine learning;Network slicing;Broadband communication","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","ETSI Zero-touch network and Service Management;Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks;asynchronous time-sensitive networking;ultra-reliable low-latency communication capabilities;mobile broadband traffic;quality-of-service support;substrate network;low-latency services;5G data flows;5G backhauling;TSN transport network slicing;Asynchronous Traffic Shaper;asynchronous TSN","","2","","15","","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In order to enable this transition, an end-to-end comprehensive 5G architecture is needed, with capabilities to support the use cases of the different vertical industries. A key feature of this architecture is the implementation of network slicing over a single infrastructure to provision highly heterogeneous vertical services, as well as a network slicing management system capable of handling simultaneous slices. On top of the network slicing technology, functionality needs to be devised to deploy the slices required by the different vertical players and provide them with a suitable interface to manage their slice. In this article, we design a 5G mobile network architecture to support vertical industries. The proposed architecture builds on ongoing standardization efforts at 3GPP and ETSI, and incorporates additional modules to provide enhanced MANO and control functionality as well as artificial-intelligence-based data analytics.

However, the introduction of network slicing into radio access networks (RAN) can greatly increase user handover complexity in cellular networks. Specifically, both physical resource constraints on base stations (BSs) and logical connection constraints on network slices (NSs) should be considered when making a handover decision. Moreover, various service types call for an intelligent handover scheme to guarantee the diversified QoS requirements. As such, in this article, a multiagent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handover Scheme, named LESS, is proposed, with the purpose of minimizing handover cost while maintaining user QoS. Due to the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity caused by user mobility, conventional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot be applied directly. To solve these difficulties, LESS exploits the unique characteristics of slicing in designing two algorithms: 1) LESS-DL, a distributed Q-learning algorithm to make handover decisions with reduced action space but without compromising handover performance; 2) LESS-QVU, a modified Q-value update algorithm which exploits slice traffic similarity to improve the accuracy of Q-value evaluation with limited data. Thus, LESS uses LESS-DL to choose the target BS and NS when a handover occurs, while Q-values are updated by using LESS-QVU. The convergence of LESS is theoretically proved in this article. Simulation results show that LESS can significantly improve network performance. In more detail, the number of handovers, handover cost and outage probability are reduced by around 50%, 65%, and 45%, respectively, when compared with traditional methods.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3031079","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971099); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663476); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S02476X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223714","Handover;RAN slicing;multi-agent reinforcement learning;quality of service","Handover;Quality of service;Network slicing;Radio access networks;Cellular networks","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","cellular networks;handover decision;multiagent reinforcement learning;smart handover scheme;QoS;reinforcement learning algorithms;distributed Q-learning algorithm;modified Q-value update algorithm;handover mechanism;radio access network slicing;mobile networks;slice traffic","","3","","31","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge of 5G is to assure the network performance and different quality of service (QoS) requirements of different services, such as machine type communication (MTC), enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) over 5G networks. Unlike the previous ”one size fits all” system, the softwarization, slicing and network capability exposure of 5G provide dynamic programming capabilities for QoS assurance. With the increasing complexity and dynamics of the network behaviors, it is non-trivial for a programmer to develop traditional software codes to schedule the network resources based on expert knowledge, especially when there is no quantitative relationship among the network events and the QoS anomalies. Machine learning is a computer technology that gives computer systems the ability to learn with data and improve performance and accuracy of decision making on a specific task, without being explicitly programmed. The areas of machine learning and communication technology are converging. Supervised learning based QoS assurance architecture for 5G networks was proposed in this paper. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can intelligently learn the network environment and react to dynamic situations. They can learn from the fore passed QoS related information and anomalies, and further reconstruct the relationship between the fore passed data and the current QoS related anomalies automatically and accurately. They, then, can trigger automatic mitigation or provide suggestions. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can also predict future QoS related anomalies with high confidence.

The distance representation is inspired by previous knowledge of the domain to increase the generalizability of the deep learning models for radiation treatment planning. Conventional knowledge-based planning methods extract engineered features from 3D CT-scan images, as well as other patients' features, to predict the best achievable dose in a cancerous area and other organs at risk. Recent studies have shown higher accuracy in voxel-level dose prediction using deep learning models compared to the conventional machine learning approaches. Since the data resources for training these models are limited, most of the studies use 2D contour information to represent the patient anatomy. This representation loses volumetric information, and it is sensitive to small changes in patient orientation and translation. The distance-based representation introduced in this paper is inspired by the domain knowledge and is able to maintain the volumetric distance information despite the 2D slicing of 3D CT-image. According to prior studies in the radiation treatment planning domain, there is a strong association between the organs-at-risk distance from the cancerous volume and the patient's vulnerability to receive excessive dose. Therefore, the contour value in prior representation was replaced by voxel distance from cancerous volume. This modification in representation makes it transition and orientation invariant and adds potential robustness to patient positioning differences during the imaging/planning process. We evaluated the distance-based deep learning models through experiments for prediction of prostate cancer patients' vulnerability and voxel-level dose distribution using convolutional neural network and U-net models, respectively. The results were compared with contour-based U-net model as well as conventional machine learning with engineered representations. We found that the performance was comparable or higher than the prior state-of-the-art results for prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction.","","978-1-7281-1867-3","10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983412","deep learning;knowledge-based planning;KBP;intensity-modulated radiation therapy;IMRT planning","","biological organs;cancer;computerised tomography;convolutional neural nets;dosimetry;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;radiation therapy","3D CT-scan images;voxel-level dose prediction;machine learning approaches;volumetric distance information;radiation treatment planning domain;organs-at-risk distance;cancerous volume;distance-based deep learning model;prostate cancer patients;U-net models;prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction;prostate radiation treatment;distance representation;conventional knowledge-based planning methods;imaging-planning process;convolutional neural network","","1","","19","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

V2X communication refers to the exchange of information between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I) or between vehicles (V2V). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for the next generation of connected devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Following this idea, we propose a network slicing based communication model for vehicular networks. In this paper, we have modelled a multi-lane highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic requirements. Autonomous driving slice (exchanges safety messages) and infotainment slice (provides video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. In addition, a relaying approach is utilized to improve the performance of low signal-to-interferenceplus- noise-ratio (SINR) video streaming vehicles. These low SINR vehicles are served by other infotainment vehicles, which have high quality V2V and V2I link and are not serving as autonomous driving slice access point. An extensive Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) system level simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in which it is shown that the proposed network slicing approach increases the packet reception ratio (PRR) from 31.15% to 99.47%.","","978-3-8007-4560-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8385521","","","","","","4","","","","14 Jun 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Therefore, network slicing is included as a key feature of the 5G architecture to allow sharing a common infrastructure among different tenants, such as mobile communication providers, vertical market players, etc. In order to provide the Radio Access Network (RAN) with network slicing capabilities, mechanisms that efficiently distribute the available capacity among the different tenants while satisfying their needs are required. For this purpose, this paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for RAN capacity sharing. It makes use of the Deep Q-Network algorithm in a way that each agent is associated to a different tenant and learns the capacity to be provided to this tenant in each cell while ensuring that the service level agreements are satisfied and that the available radio resources are efficiently used. The consideration of multiple agents contributes to a better scalability and higher learning speed in comparison to single-agent approaches. In this respect, results show that the policy learnt by the agent of one tenant can be generalised and directly applied by other agents, thus reducing the complexity of the training and making the proposed solution easily scalable, e.g., to add new tenants in the system.

Stringent delay and reliability requirements need to be satisfied for both scheduled and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to enable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and media access control layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy scheduled URLLC traffic, there is lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled URLLC traffic, especially in coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic. Machine learning (ML) is an important enabler to manage this coexistence scenario due to its ability to exploit spatial/ temporal correlation in user behaviors and use of radio resources. In this article, we first study the coexistence design challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM) problem, and propose a distributed risk- aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed solution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal radio resource slicing, and proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying the delay/reliability requirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to investigate the potential of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC traffic types. The results further provide insights on the benefits of leveraging intelligent RRM.

Considering that the dynamic of service demands makes it difficult to maintain high quality of user experience and high revenue of tenants, slice reconfiguration is necessary to avoid performance degradation. Hence, this paper proposes an optimal and fast slice reconfiguration (OFSR) solution by leveraging advanced deep reinforcement Learning. To deal with the uncertain changes in resources requirement, a demand prediction model based on Markov renewal process is introduced in decision-making. Taking into account the operation costs of reconfiguring diversified slices and the constraints of available resources, the proposed OFSR scheme aims at obtaining high long-term revenue with low operation cost. Given that the convergence of the conventional reinforcement learning approach is slow to learn the optimal reconfiguration policy for different classes of slices, deep dueling neural network combined with Q-learning is applied to improve the speed of convergence. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework is effective in achieving long-term revenue for tenants and the dueling deep Q-learning approach performs better than other current approaches.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322180","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822104,61771044); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:FRF-TP-19-051A1,FRF-BD-20-11A,FRF-TP-19-002C1,RC1631); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322180","Network Slicing;Slice Reconfiguration;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Resource Allocation;Dueling Deep Q-Learning","Resource management;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling;Bandwidth;Servers;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes","slice reconfiguration;performance degradation;demand prediction model;Markov renewal process;decision-making;diversified slices;long-term revenue;reinforcement learning;optimal reconfiguration policy;deep dueling neural network;dueling deep Q-learning;dueling deep reinforcement Learning;network slicing;differentiated service demands;multiple logical networks;user experience","","","","18","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article exploits the time-varying graph theory to characterize and allocate the dynamic resources of SIN. We first introduce the overall SIN architecture, and discuss its key technologies in terms of network slicing and dynamic routing. Then, we construct a novel STAG to precisely depict the multi-dimensional time-varying resources and reveal their connection relationships in SIN.

The flexible programmability of network slicing and the decentralization of MEC facilitate the deployment of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). The caching feature of ICN can provide users with low-latency data services. Although many existing works have addressed the cache deployment problem or the cache optimization problem, most of them do not consider the issue of caching resource allocation in the dynamic and hierarchical environment. Dynamic deployment of cache nodes can improve the operator’s revenue as much as possible while accurately allocating the caching resources can reduce the user-requested latency. Therefore, in this study, a problem of the operator’s expected revenue maximization is presented in an environment combining dynamic deployment of the MECs and the caching-enabled node ICN-Gateway (ICN-GW). To solve this problem, we propose an optimal stopping theory (OST)-based dynamic hierarchical caching resources allocation (ODH-CRA) algorithm. The algorithm consists of three parts. Firstly, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution is proposed to determine the optimal deployment of the MECs. This method determines the optimal location and number of the MECs by considering deployment costs and service requirement costs synthetically. Secondly, a redeployment technique based on the OST is proposed to determine the best redeployment time of the MECs according to the values of latency violations and the service latency requirements. Finally, an improved elite genetic algorithm (IEGA) is proposed to find the optimal solution of the hierarchical caching resource allocation. This method searches the optimal scheme by maximizing the operator’s revenue joint caching costs and energy consumption. Ultimately, we perform a series of simulation experiments to compare the proposed method’s performance to dynamic and hierarchical methods. Our solution can effectively reduce the latency for users’ requesting, improve the revenue of ICN Communication Service Provider (ICSP), and provide an effective caching resource allocation scheme for the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116602","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872044,61901043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552913","Network slice;MEC;ICN;hierarchical caching resource allocation;dynamic deployment","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Costs;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Network slicing","","","","","","40","CCBY","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To surmount this challenge, service, and resource providers are looking for alternative mechanisms that can successfully facilitate managing network resources in a more dynamic, predictive, and distributed manner. New concepts of network architectures, such as software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), have paved the way to move from static to flexible networks. They make networks more flexible (i.e., network providers capable of on-demand provisioning), easily customizable, and cost effective. In this regard, network slicing is emerging as a new technology built on the concepts of the SDN and NFV. It splits a network infrastructure into isolated virtual networks and allows them to manage resources allocation individually based on their requirements and characteristics. Most of the existing solutions for network slicing are computationally expensive because of the length of time they require to estimate the resources required for each isolated slice. In addition, there is no guarantee that the resource allocation is fairly shared among users in a slice. In this paper, we propose a network slicing resource management (NSRM) mechanism to assign the required resources for each slice in a LTE network, taking into consideration the isolation of resources among different slices. In addition, NSRM aims to ensure isolation and fair sharing of distributed bandwidths between users belonging to the same slice. In NSRM, depending on requirements, each slice can be customized (e.g., each can have a different scheduling policy).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926446","Liverpool John Moores University(grant numbers:10.13039/501100004144); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753535","LTE network;network slicing;wireless virtualization;wireless resource management","Resource management;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution;Virtualization;Cellular networks;Wireless communication;Quality of service","Long Term Evolution;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","network slicing;LTE network;cellular networks;resource providers;network resources;network architectures;software-defined network;flexible networks;network providers;network infrastructure;isolated virtual networks;isolated slice;resource allocation;resource management mechanism;network function virtualization;on-demand provisioning;data traffic;scheduling policy","","9","","42","CCBY","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This survey provides a systematic overview of security and privacy issues based on prospective technologies for 6G in the physical, connection, and service layers, as well as through lessons learned from the failures of existing security architectures and state-of-the-art defenses. Two key lessons learned are as follows. First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3108618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524814","6G;security and privacy;AI security;physical layer security;connection security;service security.","Security;6G mobile communication;Privacy;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Systematics;Standards","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

MNOs are also seeking new technologies to benefit from recent advances in cloud for rapid deployments and elastically scaling services that cloud providers are mostly benefiting today. On one hand, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept can be helpful for enabling network infrastructure sharing/slicing and elasticity for “softwarization” of network elements. On the other hand, machine learning and game-theoretical concepts can also be utilized to address network management and orchestration needs of services and applications and improve network infrastructure's operational needs. In that regard, joint utilization of machine learning, game theoretical approaches and SDN concepts for network slicing can be beneficial to MNOs as well as infrastructure providers. In this paper, we utilize regret-matching based learning approach for efficient Radio Remote Head (RRH) assignments among MNOs in software-defined based cloud radio access network (C-RAN). Using game-theoretical approach, we demonstrate convergence of RRH allocations to mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and present significant performance improvements compared to traditional assignment approach.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987414","Software-Defined Networking;Game Theory;Machine Learning;C-RAN;Network Slicing","Mobile computing;Cloud computing;Games;Cellular networks;Radio access networks;Game theory","cellular radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);software defined networking","user bandwidth demands;mobile network operators;MNO;cloud providers;software-defined networking concept;SDN-based multi-tenant cellular networks;network infrastructure sharing-slicing;softwarization;machine learning;game-theoretical concepts;network management;infrastructure providers;regret-matching based learning approach;radio remote head assignments;RRH assignments;software-defined based cloud radio access network;C-RAN;mixed strategy Nash equilibrium","","4","","17","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several approaches have been suggested for computing slices based on different perspectives, including forward slicing, backward slicing, static slicing, and dynamic slicing. The applications of slicing are numerous, including testing, effort estimation, and impact analysis. Surprisingly, given the maturity of slicing, few approaches exist for visualizing slices. In this paper, we present our tool for visualizing large systems based on program slicing and through two visualization idioms: treemaps and bipartite graphs. In particular, we use treemaps to facilitate slicing-based navigation, and we use bipartite graphs to facilitate visual impact analysis by displaying relationships among system decomposition slices showing the relevant computations involving a given slicing variable. We believe our tool will support various software maintenance tasks, including providing analysts an interactive visualization of the impact of potential changes, thus allowing them to plan maintenance accordingly. Finally, we show that, through the use of both existing scalable slicing and scalable visualization approaches, our tool can facilitate analysis of large software systems.","","978-1-5090-3850-3","10.1109/VISSOFT.2016.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780165","","Visualization;Data visualization;Bipartite graph;Maintenance engineering;Software systems;Complexity theory","data visualisation;interactive systems;program slicing;software maintenance;trees (mathematics)","vizSlice;large scale software slice visualization;program slicing;forward slicing;backward slicing;static slicing;dynamic slicing;effort estimation;treemaps;slicing-based navigation;bipartite graphs;visual impact analysis;system decomposition slices;slicing variable;software maintenance;interactive visualization;large software systems","","1","","21","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The user-facing nature of Android applications further complicates matters as the slicing solution has to maintain a low overhead to avoid substantial application slowdown.In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient dynamic slicing technique for Android applications and implement it in a tool named Mandoline. The core idea behind our technique is to use minimal, low-overhead instrumentation followed by sophisticated, on-demand execution trace analysis for constructing a dynamic slice. We also contribute a benchmark suite of Android applications with manually constructed dynamic slices that use a faulty line of code as a slicing criterion.

Past studies of dynamic network provisioning mostly consider dynamic bandwidth and delay assignment in order to maximize the system throughput and minimize communication overhead. These studies leveraged Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to create dedicated end-to-end virtual networks which are called network slices. But, these works are lack of consideration of provisioning a dynamic network based on request locations where users would use the network to deploy their services. In this paper, a method for generating a network slice dynamically based on requested locations of users is proposed to support the location-aware dynamic network provisioning. The requested locations are obtained by users through a web interface, then the requested locations are encapsulated and sent to SDN controller which knows the geographical location of SDN switches. Then SDN controller sets up a location-aware network slice. To provide a viability of the proposed approach, we implemented the web interface and the protocol to share the requested locations.","","978-1-5386-1101-2","10.1109/APNOMS.2017.8094142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094142","Dynamic Network Provisioning;Software-defined networks;Network Function Virtualization;Location-aware Network Provisioning","Bandwidth;Protocols;Generators;Heuristic algorithms;Servers","protocols;quality of service;software defined networking;virtualisation","network function virtualization;leveraged software defined network;network quality of service;QoS;SDN switches;end-to-end virtual networks;SDN controller;location-aware network slice;request locations;delay assignment;dynamic bandwidth;service requirements;network services;location-aware dynamic network provisioning","","","","8","","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a single physical network, several instances of logical end-to-end networks, i.e. slices, will be instantiated to fulfill these requirements. To this end, slices should share the resources of the physical network, which consist of Core Network (CN) and Radio Access Network (RAN) resources. Herein, we focus on the Radio Resource Management (RRM) in the context of network slicing. To maximize the pooling gains, dynamic resource sharing is preferred over static sharing. However, dynamic resource sharing can lead to undesirable inter-slice influences, in particular, the contention on radio resources. In this article, we show that, although the radio resources are dynamically shared among the users of different slices, proper slice management can realize slice protection. This is achieved by adjusting the fraction of radio resources allocated to the different slices by the Packet Scheduler (PS) and by limiting the number of users admitted to the network via Admission Control (AC). We propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the parameters of PS and AC in order to ensure that the service level agreements are satisfied. Extensive system-level simulations have shown that a central entity that tunes these control parameters can greatly increase the network's performance.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761376","","Mathematical model;State estimation;Real-time systems;Measurement uncertainty;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Coordinate measuring machines","iterative methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication services","slice protection;diverse requirements;network slicing;single physical network;logical end-to-end networks;dynamic resource sharing;radio resource allocation;slice management;core network;radio access network resources;radio resource management;5G systems;packet scheduler;admission control;iterative algorithm;service level agreements","","3","","13","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network slicing allows separating the control plane from the user's plane. Various investigators have investigated how the slices that have been used for splitting paths can be measured to improve durability. In SDN, the dynamic migration of switches offers a method of offloading the load from one controller to another controller. We have reintroduced the concept of the network (dataflow) splitting for load balancing in SDN.

So far, there has been a huge investment from 5G Berlin Innovation Cluster to deliver a unique infrastructure providing opportunities for research centres, SMEs, and start-ups to develop novel solutions and products [1]. In this regard, there has been a complementary activity from Berlin Centre for Digital Transformation to develop a three-node optical network, which connects three Fraunhofer institutes, HHI, FOKUS, and IPK in a metro ring structure [2]. Additionally, there is a recently funded German national project (OTB-5G+) to develop an Open Testbed Berlin for 5G and Beyond, which will deliver a three-node ROADM network. These activities along with some other ones, like the presence of a Berlin node for two of the EU 5G trial projects (i.e., 5Genesis [3] and 5Gvinni [4]), have made Berlin a strategic spot in the evolution of the EU 5G ecosystem. Fraunhofer HHI hosts several aspects of the above-mentioned infrastructure including the 3-node ROADM metro network testbed, which provide a great opportunity to perform real-field experiments with 5G-ready RAN infrastructure and edge compute capability for realizing low-latency end-to-end use-cases. This metro network is SDN controlled and hosts edge compute node capabilities. Additionally, it could offer NFV services and will eventually support network slicing. Regarding the RAN infrastructure, currently, there are LTE base stations installed, which operate at 2.6 GHz. They will be upgraded to 5G base stations operating at 3.7 GHz as soon as they become available. The access segment, which is based on a passive WDM network, is expected to be extended by sophisticated mm-wave and optical-wireless communication links as bridges demonstrating the network extensions where optical fibers cannot be deployed. This network will be an SDN-enabled allowing the inclusion of several street 5G access points to the infrastructure. The three-node ROADM test-bed described above and shown in Fig. 1 will also host several demonstrations, including the final demonstration of metro-haul project [5]. Two of the ROADM nodes will be realized as AMEN (i.e., Access-Metro Edge Node) and the last one is MCEN (i.e., Metro-Core Edge Node), both developed in the framework of Metro-Haul project. This network will be also connected to German metro ring.

"More Accurate Dynamic Slicing for Better Supporting Software Debugging","X. Li; A.

One limitation of dynamic slicing, when used for debugging, is that it only considers program dependences that are actually observed during the execution(s) of interest. Some faults, however, involve potential, rather than actual dependences-dependences that would be observed if the correct program was executed but are missing when the faulty program is executed. In particular, traditional dynamic slicing may fail to locate faults that involve assignments that should have occurred in a correct execution and did not occur in the failing execution being debugged. Relevant slicing techniques partially address this problem by identifying missing assignments due to incorrect control-flow. However, they do not consider the case of assignments that do occur but modify the wrong memory location (e.g., the wrong element of an array). Debugging techniques based on existing dynamic slicing approaches may therefore miss faults in the presence of this kind of incorrect assignments. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of potential memory-address dependence (PMD). Intuitively, PMDs represent the dependence relationship between an instruction s that affects the computation of a memory-address ma (e.g., by defining an array index or a pointer offset) and memory read instructions that are not observed to be dependent on s but could be affected by s (i.e., access the memory at ma) in a counterfactual execution of s. We also present a technique that computes PMDs and represents them on standard dynamic dependence graphs. To assess the effectiveness of our technique for debugging, we implemented PMD-Slicer, a dynamic slicer that accounts for PMDs, and performed an empirical evaluation on a benchmark of 364 real faults and 880 fault-revealing test cases. Our results are promising, in that almost 10% of the failing tests contained cases in which PMD-Slicer generated slices that included the corresponding fault, while a traditional dynamic slicer did not. Furthermore, considering PMDs only moderately increased slice sizes.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-5778-8","10.1109/ICST46399.2020.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159078","Debugging;dynamic slicing;program dependences;potential dependences","Indexes;Debugging;Heuristic algorithms;Arrays;Benchmark testing;Java;Terminology","program debugging;program diagnostics;program slicing;program testing","corresponding fault;traditional dynamic slicer;memory-address;slice sizes;PMD-Slicer generated slices;fault-revealing test cases;standard dynamic dependence graphs;counterfactual execution;dependence relationship;PMDs;potential memory-address dependence;incorrect assignments;dynamic slicing approaches;wrong memory location;incorrect control-flow;missing assignments;relevant slicing techniques;correct execution;traditional dynamic slicing;particular slicing;faulty program;correct program;actual dependences;program dependences;automated-debugging techniques;dynamic dependence analysis;software debugging;accurate dynamic slicing","","1","","33","","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we evaluate in-depth various slicing strategies in large scale realistic industry 4.0 scenarios.

SoS models are usually complex and probabilistic, which makes statistical verification computationally expensive. To reduce this cost, dynamic slicing techniques can be applied to SoS models since both dynamic slicing and statistical verification focus on the models' execution samples. However, existing dynamic slicing techniques cannot guarantee executable accurate slices of SoS models when the models contain uncertainty. Therefore, we propose a hybrid slicing approach that combines dynamic backward slicing and modified observation-based slicing to produce accurate executable slices.

It abstracts the computation of program slicing as a language-independent object, slice monad transformer, which can be applied to semantic descriptions of the program analyzed in a modular way, forming the corresponding monadic slicing algorithms. Such algorithms allow dynamic slices to be computed directly on abstract syntax, with no needs to explicitly construct intermediate structures such as dependence graphs or to record an execution history. Simultaneously, it could describe the basic object-oriented (OO) features such as encapsulation, inheritance and dynamic binding well.

However, how to converge different types of services onto a common UAV network without deploying an individual network solution for each type of service is challenging. We tackle this challenge in this paper through slicing the UAV network, i.e., creating logical UAV networks customized for specific requirements. To this end, we formulate the UAV network slicing problem as a sequential decision problem to provide mobile broadband (MBB) services for ground mobile users while satisfying ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of UAV control and non-payload signal delivery. This problem, however, is difficult to be directly solved mainly due to the sequence-dependent characteristic and the lack of accurate location information of mobile users and accurate and tractable channel gain models in practice. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel solution approach based on learning and optimization methods. Particularly, we develop a distributed learning method to predict mobile users’ locations, where partial user location information stored on each UAV is utilized to train user location prediction networks. To achieve accurate channel gain models, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained by signal measurements at each UAV. To cope with the challenging sequence-dependent characteristic of the problem, we develop a Lyapunov-based optimization framework with provable performance guarantees to decompose the original problem into a sequence of separate optimization subproblems based on the learned results. Finally, an iterative optimization scheme joint with a successive convex approximation technique is exploited to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the Lyapunov-based optimization framework.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3088624","National Research Foundation, Singapore; Infocomm Media Development Authority through the Future Communications Research and Development Program; Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (ARF) Tier 2(grant numbers:T2EP20120-0006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453787","UAV network slicing;URLLC;mobile broadband service;learning and optimization","Ultra reliable low latency communication;Network slicing;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Payloads;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Resource management","","","","","","51","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing efficient scaling algorithms is challenging, especially for geo-distributed chains, where bandwidth costs and latencies incurred by the WAN traffic are important but difficult to handle in making scaling decisions. Existing studies have largely resorted to optimization algorithms in scaling design. Aiming at better decisions empowered by in-depth learning from experiences, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for scaling of the geo-distributed VNF chains, exploring inherent pattern of traffic variation and good deployment strategies over time. We novelly combine a recurrent neural network as the traffic model for predicting upcoming flow rates and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for making chain placement decisions.

Yet, this is associated with high costs and lengthy roll-out times. Therefore it is desirable for multiple tenants to share one Physical Network (PN). However, this may compromise service guarantees, potentially violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Network slicing aims to address this challenge by transparently dividing one common infrastructure into multiple, logically independent networks. Thereby tenants are isolated from one another, ensuring the fulfillment of hard performance guarantees.

Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). While concluding the paper, it is shown that the LSTM has outperformed the rest of classification techniques with promising results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964697","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951149","Future internet architectures;machine learning;network reliability;privacy;resource management;security;software defined networks;vehicular networks","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security","5G mobile communication;computer network management;computer network reliability;convolutional neural nets;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","software defined networking;vehicular network environments;resource classification;convolutional neural network;deep neural network;5G vehicular network resource management;SDN-based 5G cellular network;vehicular Internet infrastructures;machine learning;radio access network;NFV;network function virtualization;flow-based policy framework;vehicle to vehicle communication;V2V communication;wireless virtualization;LSTM;long short-term memory;CNN;DNN","","9","","28","CCBY","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the hardware-specific MAR is costly and heavy, and the App-based MAR requires an additional download and installation and it also lacks cross-platform ability. These limitations hamper the pervasive promotion of MAR. This paper argues that mobile Web AR (MWAR) holds the potential to become a practical and pervasive solution that can effectively scale to millions of end-users because MWAR can be developed as a lightweight, cross-platform, and low-cost solution for end-to-end delivery of MAR. The main challenges for making MWAR a reality lie in the low efficiency for dense computing in Web browsers, a large delay for real-time interactions over mobile networks, and the lack of standardization. The good news is that the newly emerging 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) cellular networks can mitigate these issues to some extent via techniques such as network slicing, device-to-device communication, and mobile edge computing. In this paper, we first give an overview of the challenges and opportunities of MWAR in the 5G era. Then we describe our design and development of a generic service-oriented framework (called MWAR5) to provide a scalable, flexible, and easy to deploy MWAR solution. We evaluate the performance of our MWAR5 system in an actually deployed 5G trial network under the collaborative configurations, which shows encouraging results. Moreover, we also share the experiences and insights from our development and deployment, including some exciting future directions of MWAR over 5G and B5G networks.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2019.09.010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851462","5G;edge computing;augmented reality;mobile augmented reality;Web augmented reality","5G mobile communication;Browsers;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Augmented reality;Edge computing;Smart phones","5G mobile communication;augmented reality;groupware;Internet;mobile computing;smart phones","mobile Web AR;low-cost solution;dense computing;Web browsers;mobile networks;device-to-device communication;mobile edge computing;MWAR5 system;wearable devices;computer vision;hardware-specific MAR;cross-platform ability;B5G networks;mobile augmented reality;mobile Web augmented reality;5G trial network;app-based MAR;collaborative configurations","","6","","","","27 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Caching the content closer to the end users is one solution to cope with these demands, but when service providers share a common physical infrastructure, managing the limited cache resources becomes more challenging. With this increased complexity, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents itself as an optimal solution. In this work, we propose a dynamic DRL-based management framework for virtual cache slicing and customized content placement. The virtualization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and it utilizes a deep Q-network to autonomously make network-wide slicing decisions and optimize the cache resource allocation. These global decisions are then mapped to the small cell stations with a dynamic resource provisioning algorithm. Lastly, a customized content placement algorithm is used to find the optimal content placement policy for each service provider. The content placement problem is first formulated as a convex optimization problem and is then solved with a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

It is based upon a “chop” operation for splitting features (columns) and a “slice” operation for clustering instances (rows). However, a number of techniques can be applied to chop and slice meaning that LearnSPN can learn a wide variety of SPNs from the same dataset. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of LearnSPN. We consider g-test and mutual information for chopping and k-means and Gaussian mixture models for slicing. Our experiments, conducted on 20 real-world datasets, suggest that the deepest SPNs tend to be learned when using mutual information for chopping and k-means for slicing. This is important, since SPNs are the only deep learning model where it is provably the case that deeper models are more expressive than shallow models. Second, our results show that the pair of g-test and Gaussian mixture models tends to yield the most accurate SPNs, especially on larger datasets. These results suggest that the particular combination of mutual information and k-means may be prone to overfitting. Lastly, we examine the sparseness of the learned SPN. Our experiments show that the pair of g-test and Gaussian mixture models regularly yields SPNs with fewer edges. This knowledge is beneficial to SPN learning algorithms that penalize networks with more edges. Our study then extends the SPN deep learning literature in both practical and theoretical directions.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280810","","Mutual information;Clustering algorithms;Gaussian mixture model;Machine learning;Computer science;Electronic mail","Gaussian processes;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","sum-product networks;LearnSPN;standard unsupervised learning algorithm;chop operation;splitting features;slice operation;clustering instances;SPNs;SPN learning algorithms;shallow models;deeper models;deep learning model;deepest SPNs;real-world datasets;slicing;Gaussian mixture models;chopping;mutual information","","1","","25","","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network slicing and edge computing are key technologies for fulfilling the diverse requirements of these applications efficiently. We define a cellular network with the edge computing capability as cellular edge computing network. Dynamically slicing a cellular edge computing network is challenging because it needs to orchestrate multi-domain resources and ensure isolation among network slices. In this paper, we present the VirtualEdge system that enables the dynamic creation of a virtual node (vNode) on top of a physical cellular edge computing node to serve the traffic and workloads of a network slice. VirtualEdge introduces a realizable multi-domain resource orchestration and virtualization that provides isolation among network slices without losing the efficiency in virtualizing the radio resources. To efficiently orchestrate multi-domain resources, we design a new learning-assisted algorithm that allows the resource orchestrator to optimize the utilization of physical resources without knowing the utility functions of individual vNodes. For the resource virtualization, we develop a heuristic algorithm and a credit-based queue management scheme to dynamically map virtual radio and computing resources to underlying physical resources, respectively. VirtualEdge is developed and implemented based on the OpenAirInterface LTE and CUDA GPU computing platforms, and its performance is validated through both experiments and large-scale simulations.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884864","Multi-Domain Resource Orchestration;Network Slicing;Cellular Computing Networks;Network Virtualization","Edge computing;Resource management;Network slicing;Virtualization;Heuristic algorithms;Radio access networks;Graphics processing units","5G mobile communication;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;mobile computing;queueing theory;telecommunication computing;virtualisation","virtual radio;VirtualEdge;CUDA GPU computing platforms;compute-intensive applications;cellular network;cellular edge computing network;multidomain resources;virtual node;physical cellular edge;network slice;radio resources;resource orchestrator;resource virtualization;OpenAirInterface LTE;5G network;network slicing;learning-assisted algorithm;credit-based queue management scheme","","6","","27","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the dynamic slicing technique, the programmers can follow data and control flow along the program execution trace to the root cause. However, the technique usually fails to work on omission bugs, i.e., the faults which are caused by missing executing some code. In many cases, dynamic slicing over-skips the root cause when an omission bug happens, leading the debugging process to a dead end. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the omission bugs in the Defects4J bug repository. Our study shows that (1) omission bugs are prevalent (46.4%) among all the studied bugs; (2) there are repeating patterns on causes and fixes of the omission bugs; (3) the patterns of fixing omission bugs serve as a strong hint to break the slicing dead end. Based on our findings, we train a neural network model on the omission bugs in Defects4J repository to recommend where to approach when slicing can no long work.

However, current data tools are still primitive when it comes to helping users trace model performance problems all the way to the data. We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are problematic and large. We propose SliceFinder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial.

Side Channel Attack (SCA) is a typical attack for slices that share resources in the same hardware. Considering the risk of SCA among slices, this paper investigates how to effectively allocate heterogeneous resources for the slices under their different security requirements. Then, a SCA-aware Resource Allocation (SCA-RA) algorithm is proposed for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (URLLC) and Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) slices in 5G RAN. The objective is to maximize the number of slices accommodated in 5G RAN. With dynamic slice requests, simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in two different network scenarios. Simulation results indicate that compared with benchmark, SCA-RA algorithm can effectively reduce blocking probability of slice requests.

The RAN slice is defined as a logical network able to provide a variety of services separately in a RAN. In adaptive RAN, an efficient slice admission control (SAC) scheme for RAN slices is required. Recently, research on applying a machine learning (ML) to facilitate efficient slice resource management and SAC in 5G RAN slicing environments has been discussed. However, the training time for the existing SAC scheme based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework (DRLF) takes too long to achieve an acceptable level of performance. Since it takes a long time to learn, it is difficult to guarantee sufficient performance in the early phase of the operating period. In this paper, we propose a SAC based on an ensemble learning method (ELM) to reduce learning time and improve performance for the adaptive RAN. Our evaluation with ELM for the improved utilization of resource blocks (RBs) shows that the proposed approach outperforms the other approaches.","","978-1-7281-7307-8","10.1109/GCWkshps50303.2020.9367536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367536","5G;Adaptive RAN;RAN Slicing;Slice Admission Control;Ensemble Learning;Reinforcement Learning","Training;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Reinforcement learning;Resource management;Reliability;Radio access networks","5G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability","communication services;advanced 5G system;RAN slice;adaptive RAN;machine learning;efficient slice resource management;future 5G system;performance targets;high reliability;adaptive radio access network system;ensemble learning method-based slice admission control scheme;logical network;SAC scheme;5G RAN slicing environments;deep reinforcement learning framework;DRLF;ELM;resource blocks","","","","18","","5 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, on one hand, 5G incorporates the framework of network slicing as a flexible and future-proof means to support vertical industries on a common infrastructure. On the other hand, 5G extends the notion of a conventional radio resource toward a native use of other available resources, namely, the unlicensed spectrum (varying from 1 to 100 GHz) in an LAA way, to respond to stringent and diverse service requirements. This article places the aforementioned key 5G features in focus, and proposes a new framework, namely LAA as a service, which aims to provide different LAA configurations to be used on demand in a service-oriented manner. First, the 3GPP standardization roadmap is presented, focusing on the challenges that need to be taken into consideration in order to allow for opportunistic complementary unlicensed spectrum usage for 5G assuming very demanding 5G services in terms of key performance indicators such as latency and reliability. The LAA configurations can be seen as different RAN configuration modes, that is, the RAN part of the end-to-end (E2E) network slice. Furthermore, as a particular 5G case study, a very dynamic and interference-limited scenario, which is a 5G ultra-dense network scenario with unplanned/dynamic small cells, is exemplified to show that dynamic radio topology coupled with LAA as a service is a promising and complementary enhancement.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.2018.1700061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334917","","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Interference;Long Term Evolution;Wireless fidelity;3GPP","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;radio access networks;radio receivers;radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology","key enabler;slice-aware 5G RAN;early drop nonstandalone version;business operations;network slicing;conventional radio resource;3GPP standardization roadmap;opportunistic complementary unlicensed spectrum usage;key performance indicators;end-to-end network slice;5G ultra-dense network scenario;dynamic radio topology;wireless communication;service requirements;5G services;5G mobile communication;performance enhancement;vertical industries;key 5G features;LAA configurations;RAN configuration modes;5G case study;unplanned small cells;dynamic small cells;interference-limited scenario;frequency 1 GHz to 100 GHz","","4","","12","","11 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The proposed framework consists of network-level slicing and gNodeB-level slicing. In the network level, radio RBs are pre-allocated to each gNodeB in a large time scale, while in the gNodeB level, the pre-allocated RBs are dynamically scheduled to the services in response to the small time scale (mini-slot-level) RB request variations. The proposed framework allows the accommodation of time-varying traffic loads of differentiated services over multiple gNodeBs, while enabling dynamic inter-gNodeB RB sharing to increase the resource multiplexing gain.

Network slicing and spectrum sharing have been deemed as two prominent solutions, which, however, are barely jointly studied in the literature. In this article, standing on both aspects, we propose a service-oriented spectrum-aware RAN-slicing trading (SSRT) scheme to achieve a dynamic on-demand RAN slicing under the spectrum sharing scenario. For the SSRT scheme, we jointly slice multidimensional resources, including heterogeneous spectrums (licensed and shared), time, and network facilities (nodes, radios, and powers). In particular, considering the uncertainty of shared spectrums, we distinguish them from the traditional licensed ones to fulfill different types of sessions, which are classified into delay tolerant and delay sensitive. To achieve an effective isolation, we construct a 4-D conflict graph and formulate the slice generation problem into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, where a cross-layer resource allocation based on a hybrid transmission mode is designed for the customization. To cope with the difficulties when solving the problem, we employ the column generation algorithm to obtain the final slicing result over all the resources. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2997342","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801080); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT20RC(4)007); Doctoral Research Initiation Fund of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2019-BS-049); Open Research Fund of Shaanxi Province Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security(grant numbers:ICNS201803); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671102,U1933104); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:U.S. CNS- 1350230 (CAREER),CNS-1702850); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099798","Column generation (CG) algorithm;network slicing;service oriented;spectrum aware;spectrum sharing","Internet of Things;Network slicing;Resource management;Radio access networks;Scheduling;Electronic mail;Cognitive radio","graph theory;integer programming;nonlinear programming;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation","service-oriented spectrum-aware RAN-slicing trading scheme;spectrum sharing scenario;SSRT scheme;heterogeneous spectrums;network facilities;slice generation problem;Internet-of-Things applications;telecommunications networks;service diversity;network slicing;dynamic on-demand RAN slicing;multidimensional resources;delay tolerant;delay sensitive;4D conflict graph;mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem;MINLP problem;cross-layer resource allocation;hybrid transmission mode;column generation algorithm","","1","","48","IEEE","26 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While these methods are effective for localizing a faulty statement in a program, they have some practical drawbacks. One of the drawbacks with dynamic slicing is that if a program is large, the sliced program will also remain large in general. One of the drawbacks with SFL is that the suspiciousness of faulty statements may become low, even if only one fault exists in a program. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an effective fault localization method that iteratively generates test cases that cause an error using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver such that the result of dynamic slicing for each generated failed test case is distinct. Using test cases generated by our method, the suspiciousness of a faulty statement is always maximum when a target has only one fault. Furthermore, the number of statements that have maximum suspiciousness, that is, the number of fault candidates, is smaller than that obtained by conventional dynamic slicing. In this paper, we explain our proposed method by applying it to MATLAB/Simulink models.","","978-1-5090-3674-5","10.1109/ICSTW.2016.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528961","Fault Localization;Dynamic Slicing;SMT Solver;Test Generation","Software packages;Vehicle dynamics;Data models;Conferences;Fault diagnosis;Switches;Mathematical model","computability;program slicing","dynamic slicing;SMT solver;spectrum-based fault localization;satisfiability modulo theory","","1","","30","","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, SMART needs to frequently exchange data among a network, which brings tremendous communication overhead to sensor nodes. Faced with the above mentioned issues, this paper first proposes Energy-efficient Privacy Preserving data Aggregation protocol based on slicing (EPPA). We adopt a new slicing mode to reduce the numbers of slices, which can significantly prevent the data from being compromised and decrease the communication overhead. Meanwhile, an enhanced scheme based on EPPA called the Multi-function Privacy Preserving data Aggregation protocol (MPPA) is presented. MPPA focus on multiple aggregation functions, such as Max/Min, Mean and other aggregation functions.

However, the acquisition of transmitter side CSI entails many challenges. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted CSI estimation technique in highly mobile vehicular networks, based on the fact that the propagation environment (scatterers, reflectors) is almost identical thereby allowing a data driven deep neural network (DNN) to learn the non-linear CSI relations with negligible overhead. Moreover, we formulate and solve a dynamic network slicing based resource allocation problem for vehicular user equipments (VUEs) requesting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC) traffic slices. The formulation considers a threshold rate violation probability minimization for the eMBB slice while satisfying a probabilistic threshold rate criterion for the URLLC slice. Simulation result shows that an overhead reduction of 50% can be achieved with 12% increase in threshold violations compared to an ideal case with perfect CSI knowledge.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-7440-2","10.1109/ICCWorkshops49005.2020.9145297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145297","5G and beyond;deep learning;V2X;resource allocation;URLLC;eMBB;network slicing","Resource management;Downlink;Machine learning;Reliability;Estimation;Wireless communication;MIMO communication","5G mobile communication;channel estimation;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave scattering;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;minimisation;neural nets;probability;radio transmitters;radiowave propagation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","VUE;enhanced mobile broadband;ultrareliable low latency traffic slices;threshold rate violation probability minimization;probabilistic threshold rate criterion;vehicular user equipments;dynamic network slicing;DNN;propagation environment;fifth generation wireless communication systems;multiple-input multiple-output system;joint URLLC-eMBB resource allocation;resource allocation problem;nonlinear CSI relations;deep neural network;highly mobile vehicular networks;channel state information;MIMO transmission;energy efficiency;higher spectrum efficiency;5G wireless communication systems;deep learning assisted CSI estimation","","2","","20","","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, the networks become increasingly dense, heterogeneous, decentralized, and ad hoc in nature, and they encompass numerous and diverse network entities. Consequently, different objectives, such as high throughput and low latency, need to be achieved in terms of service, and resource allocation must be designed and optimized accordingly. However, considering the dynamics and uncertainty that inherently exist in wireless network environments, conventional approaches for service and resource management that require complete and perfect knowledge of the systems are inefficient or even inapplicable. Inspired by the success of machine learning in solving complicated control and decision-making problems, in this article we focus on deep reinforcement- learning (DRL)-based approaches that allow network entities to learn and build knowledge about the networks and thus make optimal decisions locally and independently. We first overview fundamental concepts of DRL and then review related works that use DRL to address various issues in 5G networks. Finally, we present an application of DRL for 5G network slicing optimization. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with baseline solutions.","1556-6080","","10.1109/MVT.2019.2903655","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601336); A STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research(grant numbers:RGANS1906,WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); NTU internal funding SUG-CoE(grant numbers:M4082287); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8683970","","5G mobile communication;Optimization;Vehicle dynamics;Neural networks;Power control;Wireless networks","5G mobile communication;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","future-generation wireless networks;mobile data traffic;diverse network entities;resource allocation;wireless network environments;resource management;decision-making problems;DRL;5G network slicing optimization;ad hoc networks;deep reinforcement learning;machine learning","","43","","15","IEEE","9 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

With this paradigm, it is essential to allocate to each slice the needed resources, which requires the ability to forecast their respective demands. To this end, we present DeepCog, a novel data analytics tool for the cognitive management of resources in 5G systems. DeepCog forecasts the capacity needed to accommodate future traffic demands within individual network slices while accounting for the operator's desired balance between resource overprovisioning (i.e., allocating resources exceeding the demand) and service request violations (i.e., allocating less resources than required). To achieve its objective, DeepCog hinges on a deep learning architecture that is explicitly designed for capacity forecasting. Comparative evaluations with real-world measurement data prove that DeepCog's tight integration of machine learning into resource orchestration allows for substantial (50% or above) reduction of operating expenses with respect to resource allocation solutions based on state-of-the-art mobile traffic predictors. Moreover, we leverage DeepCog to carry out an extensive first analysis of the trade-off between capacity overdimensioning and unserviced demands in adaptive, sliced networks and in presence of real-world traffic.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737488","","Resource management;Deep learning;Base stations;Neural networks;Maximum likelihood detection;Nonlinear filters;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;cognitive radio;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","cognitive network management;sliced 5G networks;network slicing;future 5G networks;network infrastructure;novel data analytics tool;cognitive management;future traffic demands;individual network slices;resource overprovisioning;deep learning architecture;capacity forecasting;real-world measurement data;resource orchestration;adaptive networks;sliced networks;DeepCog;resource allocation solutions;mobile traffic predictors","","38","","30","","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Network Slicing (NS) are gaining momentum not only in research but also in IT industry representing the drivers of 5G. NS is an approach to network operations allowing the partition of a physical topology into multiple independent virtual networks, called network slices (or slices). Within a single slice, a set of Service Function Chains (SFCs) is defined and the network resources, e.g. bandwidth, can be provisioned dynamically on demand according to specific Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Traditional schemes for network resources provisioning based on static policies may lead to poor resource utilization and suffer from scalability issues. In this article, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for performing dynamic SFC resources allocation in NFV-SDN enabled metro-core optical networks. RL allows to build a self-learning system able to solve highly complex problems by employing RL agents to learn policies from an evolving network environment. In particular, we build an RL system able to optimize the resources allocation of SFCs in a multi-layer network (packet over flexi-grid optical layer). The RL agent decides if and when to reconfigure the SFCs, given state of the network and historical traffic traces.

In this context, we formulate a binary non-convex problem that maximizes the aggregate capacity of multiple network slices. The resulting spectrum allocation minimizes the inter-numerology interference under the frequent channel fluctuations characterizing the various users. To address the computational complexity of the designed objective function, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design a model-free solution computation.

In this paper we consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.","","978-3-948377-02-1","10.1109/ITC3249928.2020.00026","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355538","Age of Information;IoT;MDP;pricing","5G mobile communication;Smart cities;Pricing;Telecommunication traffic;Data collection;Internet of Things;Tuning","cloud computing;Internet of Things;optimisation;pricing;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IoT service;optimal pricing scheme;MSP;trade-off between slicing costs;uploaded IoT data;joint traffic offloading;5G IoT networks;5G cellular technology;IoT-based applications;Mobile Service Provider;smart city service;IoT data readings;rescales bandwidth;service functions;5G network slicing functions;heterogeneous access technologies;different site types;different infrastructure providers;service depending;specific access technology;regional sites;IoT data collection patterns;pricing mechanism;traffic load;highly congested locations;more expensive locations;lesser charged ones","","","","20","","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of these applications will be critical in the sense that human lives will depend on the availability and integrity of these applications and the underlying network infrastructure. Consequently, protecting 5G networks against cyber-attacks is of fundamental importance. Implementing the security architecture for mobile net-work functions as standardized by 3GPP is an essential pillar for building highly secure and reliable 5G networks, but also carefully protecting the cloud infrastructure and the virtualized network functions as well as securing the highly dynamic network operations require adequate attention.

However, complying with service-level agreements (SLAs) is often challenging with the softwarization of networks. To this end, we propose different methods and techniques in this paper to solve some crucial problems related to flow provisioning with SLA guarantees. The paper is divided into two parts: The first part focuses on the SLA-driven design of SDNs. First, we propose Bitstream, a programmable SDN protocol that can provide carrier-class features. We demonstrate Bitstream on the test-bed of custom-built FPGA-based Terabit white-boxes. We show the effectiveness of Bitstream in providing low latency and 50ms restoration in case of faults. Next, we propose techniques to make Bitstream more application-centric by including delay requirements of service requests. In the second part, we shift our focus to Network Function Virtualization (NFV). One of the biggest hurdles of adopting NFV is to provide a similar performance what a service provider is accustomed to with the traditional network hardware. First, we design an end-to-end service provider network with NFV data-centers. To provide highly-available services, we create an ILP framework intending to maximize the service provider's profit. We then propose a robust optimization extension for handling traffic uncertainty. Next, we propose a service function chain (SFC) realization theory that compares the requirements of an SFC request to the available resources in NFV infrastructure while providing availability and delay guarantees for the dynamic arrival of requests. Finally, we present an NFV use-case in the virtualized slicing of 5G networks. We propose a dynamic network slicing algorithm that creates/deletes/modifies slices while optimizing underlying virtualized resources. To handle uncertainty in the traffic requests, a stochastic optimization extension is also proposed.","","978-1-7281-8159-2","10.1109/NFV-SDN50289.2020.9289877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9289877","SDN;NFV;Service function chaining;Availability;Programmability;5G;Network Slicing","Protocols;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Delays;Network function virtualization;Optimization;Next generation networking","cloud computing;computer centres;field programmable gate arrays;optimisation;quality of service;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","service requests;custom-built FPGA-based Terabit white-boxes;Bitstream;SLA-driven design;SLA guarantees;flow provisioning;service-level agreements;SDNs;next-generation software-defined networks;SLA-aware flow;dynamic network slicing algorithm;delay guarantees;service function chain realization theory;highly-available services;NFV data-centers;end-to-end service provider network;traditional network hardware;Network Function Virtualization","","","","29","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to various application backgrounds and ubiquitous social interactions of IoT services, the heterogeneous and social-driven resource requirement of users should be carefully assessed in resource allocation for the sliced 5G wireless network. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired wireless resource allocation scheme with slice characteristic perception is proposed, which comprehensively analyzes the properties of slices and converts them into a network profit model of resource utilization. Specifically, personalized service preferences and evolutionary interest relationships of users are exploited to model the complex and dynamic network environment with cellular automaton, and a biologically inspired allocation strategy of virtual wireless resource is proposed on the requirements of continuously updated user groups.

Furthermore, recently proposed solutions to scalable URLLC (e.g., machine learning aided URLLC for driverless vehicles) are ill-suited to critical mMTC whose machine type users have minimal energy budget and computing capability that should be (tightly) optimized for given tasks. To this end, our paper aims to characterize promising use cases of critical mMTC and search for their possible solutions. To this end, we first review the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies for separate mMTC and URLLC services and then identify key challenges from conflicting SOTA requirements, followed by potential approaches to prospective critical mMTC solutions at different layers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010271","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP); Korea Government through the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIT) through the Development of Beyond 5G Mobile Communication Technologies (Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency, and Massive Connectivity) and Combined Access Technologies for Cellular Based Industrial Automation Systems(grant numbers:2017-0-00724); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144229","Ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC);massive machine type communications (mMTC);critical mMTC;5G;beyond 5G","5G mobile communication;Reliability;Haptic interfaces;Delays;Wireless communication;Scalability;Drones","cellular radio;disasters;factory automation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","key service types;fifth-generation communication systems;wireless factory automation;scalable URLLC;machine type users;URLLC services;prospective critical mMTC solutions;critical mMTC;time 4.0 ms","","11","","131","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, user mobility’s impact on the optimal resource allocation within and between slices deserves more attention. Slices and their dedicated resources should be offered where the services are to be consumed to minimize network latency and associated overheads and costs. Different mobility patterns lead to different resource re-allocation triggers, leading eventually to slice mobility when enough resources are to be migrated. The selection of the proper triggers for resource re-allocation and related slice mobility patterns is challenging due to triggers’ multiplicity and overlapping nature. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of two Deep Reinforcement Learning based algorithms for allowing a fine-grained selection of mobility triggers that may instantiate slice and resource mobility actions. While the first proposed algorithm relies on a value-based learning method, the second one exploits a hybrid approach to optimize the action selection process. We present an enhanced ETSI Network Function Virtualization edge computing architecture that incorporates the studied mechanisms to implement service and slice migration.

"Warped-Slicer: Efficient Intra-SM Slicing through Dynamic Resource Partitioning for GPU Multiprogramming","Q. Xu; H. Jeon; K. Kim; W. W. Ro; M.

But even with the best effort, exposing massive thread-level parallelism from a single GPU kernel, particularly from general purpose applications, is going to be a difficult challenge. In some cases, even if there is sufficient thread-level parallelism in a kernel, there may not be enough available memory bandwidth to support such massive concurrent thread execution. Hence, GPU resources may be underutilized as more general purpose applications are ported to execute on GPUs. In this paper, we explore multiprogramming GPUs as a way to resolve the resource underutilization issue. There is a growing hardware support for multiprogramming on GPUs. Hyper-Q has been introduced in the Kepler architecture which enables multiple kernels to be invoked via tens of hardware queue streams. Spatial multitasking has been proposed to partition GPU resources across multiple kernels. But the partitioning is done at the coarse granularity of streaming multiprocessors (SMs) where each kernel is assigned to a subset of SMs. In this paper, we advocate for partitioning a single SM across multiple kernels, which we term as intra-SM slicing. We explore various intra-SM slicing strategies that slice resources within each SM to concurrently run multiple kernels on the SM. Our results show that there is not one intra-SM slicing strategy that derives the best performance for all application pairs. We propose Warped-Slicer, a dynamic intra-SM slicing strategy that uses an analytical method for calculating the SM resource partitioning across different kernels that maximizes performance. The model relies on a set of short online profile runs to determine how each kernel's performance varies as more thread blocks from each kernel are assigned to an SM. The model takes into account the interference effect of shared resource usage across multiple kernels. The model is also computationally efficient and can determine the resource partitioning quickly to enable dynamic decision making as new kernels enter the system. We demonstrate that the proposed Warped-Slicer approach improves performance by 23% over the baseline multiprogramming approach with minimal hardware overhead.","1063-6897","978-1-4673-8947-1","10.1109/ISCA.2016.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551396","GPUs;scheduling;multiprogramming;multi-kernel;resource management","Kernel;Graphics processing units;Resource management;Registers;Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Hardware","decision making;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;multiprogramming;multi-threading;resource allocation","Warped-Slicer;streaming multiprocessor;intraSM slicing;dynamic resource partitioning;graphics processing unit;GPU;multiprogramming;thread-level parallelism;resource underutilization;Hyper-Q;Kepler architecture;decision making","","29","","56","","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior slicing approaches have targeted traditional desktop/server platforms, rather than mobile platforms such as Android. Slicing mobile, event-based systems is challenging due to their asynchronous callback construction and the IPC (interprocess communication)- heavy, sensor-driven, timing-sensitive nature of the platform. To address these problems, we introduce AndroidSlicer1, the first slicing approach for Android. AndroidSlicer combines a novel asynchronous slicing approach for modeling data and control dependences in the presence of callbacks with lightweight and precise instrumentation; this allows slicing for apps running on actual phones, and without requiring the app's source code. Our slicer is capable of handling a wide array of inputs that Android supports without adding any noticeable overhead. Experiments on 60 apps from Google Play show that AndroidSlicer is effective (reducing the number of instructions to be examined to 0.3% of executed instructions) and efficient (app instrumentation and post-processing combined takes 31 seconds); all while imposing a runtime overhead of just 4%. We present three applications of AndroidSlicer that are particularly relevant in the mobile domain: (1) finding and tracking input parts responsible for an error/crash, (2) fault localization, i.e., finding the instructions responsible for an error/crash, and (3) reducing the regression test suite. Experiments with these applications on an additional set of 18 popular apps indicate that AndroidSlicer is effective for Android testing and debugging.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811953","Mobile apps, Android, Dynamic analysis","Smart phones;Registers;Computer crashes;Testing;Runtime;Debugging;Pins","Android (operating system);mobile computing;program debugging;program slicing;program testing","timing-sensitive nature;AndroidSlicer1;modeling data;control dependences;lightweight instrumentation;precise instrumentation;executed instructions;mobile domain;tracking input parts;regression test suite;Android testing;debugging;dynamic program slicing;mobile platforms;mobile event-based systems;asynchronous callback construction;IPC;interprocess communication;asynchronous slicing approach","","3","","32","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic deployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the same physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that allows network infrastructure owners to dynamically “slice” and “serve” their network resources (i. e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs. Once the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each MVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum resources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the network owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is minimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing enforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we design three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the RSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through simulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio peripherals. Experimental results reveal that not only do our algorithms enforce the slicing policies, but can also double the total network throughput when intra-MVNO power control policies are used in conjunction.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737481","Network Slicing;5G;Radio Access Network (RAN);Interference Management","Interference;Approximation algorithms;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Signal processing algorithms;Radio access networks;Throughput","5G mobile communication;approximation theory;computational complexity;radio access networks;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;software radio;virtualisation;wireless channels","slicing policy;intra-MVNO power control policies;virtualized 5G systems;next-generation wireless systems;dynamic deployment;heterogeneous services;physical infrastructure;network infrastructure owners;network resources;RAN slicing enforcement problem;radio access network slicing;mobile virtual network operators;spectrum resource allocation;software-defined radio peripherals;NP-hardness problem;network throughput;approximation algorithms;performance evaluations;radio access network softwarization;radio access network virtualization","","19","","39","","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a distributed market design, lever-aging smart contracts technology, where the brokering mechanism is operated and validated by all of the parties involved. In addition, we use blockchain technology to enable a manipulation-proof record-keeping system, where a record is accepted into the ledger only when all the parties have reached a consensus to do so.

However, current data tools are still primitive when it comes to helping users trace model performance problems all the way to the data. We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are large and problematic. We propose Slice Finder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731353","data slicing;model validation","Data models;Decision trees;Lattices;Search problems;Analytical models;Training;Loss measurement","data mining;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;program slicing;statistical analysis","model performance problems;slicing data;validation data;model validation;arbitrary slices;interpretable slices;arbitrary subsets;Slice Finder;model fairness;automated data slicing;machine learning systems","","3","","11","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation results show that for representative user arrival statistics, dynamic allocation of radio resources significantly lowers the percentage of dropped packets. In addition, they reveal that the triggers for dynamic allocation of resources across coexisting virtual networks occur every other time interval under the worst case traffic variation in the system (i.e., traffic varies every time interval).

In this paper, we propose a resource allocation model for 5G virtualized networks in a heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. In our model, each network slice has a resource demand vector for each of its building virtual network functions (VNFs). We then formulate the optimal resource allocation as a convex optimization problem maximizing the overall system utility as a function of the slice thicknesses with the constraints of the data centers' resource capacities. The slice thickness variables together with the demand vectors determine the amount of resources allocated to each slice. We further propose a distributed solution for the resource allocation problem based on auction/game theory by forming a resource auction between the slices and the data centers (DCs). It is shown that the resource allocation game has a unique Nash equilibrium and its solution is the same as the solution of the centralized system optimization problem, i.e., in equilibrium the slice thicknesses maximize the overall system utility.

Network Slicing (NS) is a new paradigm which aims to assign different services to a logically dedicated network. A network slice can host multiple services of similar requirements. The traffic flows belonging to a service are processed by a sequence of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) which form a Service Function Chain (SFC). To utilize the resources efficiently, an operator can share the same VNF instance for multiple SFCs. The CPU utilization of a VNF instance can increase when new flows are accepted. This may increase the VNF delay which can result in the violation of SLA requirements of the existing flows. Therefore, an efficient VNF selection to form SFCs while meeting the SLA requirements is an important aspect that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we address the VNF selection problem for an SFC with the goal of supporting more number of SFCs by considering the dynamic variation of VNF delay. We develop a heuristic algorithm namely PENDANT which considers the effect of CPU utilization on VNF delay and migrates flows to other VNF instances to avoid SLA violations.","","978-1-7281-3627-1","10.1109/5GWF.2019.8911716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911716","","Delays;Heuristic algorithms;5G mobile communication;Noise measurement;Optimization;Network function virtualization;Linear programming","5G mobile communication;computer centres;contracts;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","efficient VNF selection;SFC;SLA requirements;VNF selection problem;VNF delay;heuristic algorithm;CPU utilization;migrates flows;VNF instance;SLA violations;diverse services;different service requirements;logically dedicated network;network slice;similar requirements;virtual network functions;SLA-aware network function selection algorithm;existing flows;multiple SFCs;service function chain;traffic flows","","","","12","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the reservation of these resources will come at an additional cost to the SP, which motivates the main objective of this paper: To develop a strategy that will allow the SP to determine the optimal amount of resources it should reserve ahead of time so that its future QoS constraints are met with minimal risk of revenue loss (i.e. from over reservation).

Even though existing studies have shown how to perform 5G RAN slicing to flexibly provision service according to their initial requirements, a proper dynamic RAN slice adjustment and migration strategy is also required to accommodate the highly dynamic nature of mobile traffic while maintaining lower service blocking. In this paper, we provide a traffic-prediction-based strategy for dynamic 5G RAN slice adjustment and migration in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) metro-aggregation networks, which targets the minimization of (1) the slice degradation penalty, which accounts for both the degradation degree and slice priority, and (2) the migrated traffic during slice migration. Our numerical results show that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the penalty and slice migration.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.403829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9242208","","Bandwidth;5G mobile communication;Substrates;Cascading style sheets;WDM networks;Optical fiber communication","5G mobile communication;radio access networks;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic;wavelength division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing;5G radio access network slicing;WDM metro-aggregation networks;slice migration;migrated traffic;slice priority;degradation degree;slice degradation penalty;traffic-prediction-based strategy;service blocking;proper dynamic RAN slice adjustment;provision service;service requirements;5G RAN slicing;substrate network resources;service provision","","","","","","28 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To implement the time slicing at the base station for reducing power consumption of smart phones, a regulation buffer is allocated at the base station. All incoming packets for individual user equipments (UEs) are temporarily buffered at the base station and then transmitted in individual bursts using the overall bandwidth. Under such a design, each UE can receive packets in a very short period and then enter the DRX sleep or idle cycle for a longer period, yielding better power saving performance. For VoD services, a playback buffering delay is usually required at the UE to compensate for the network jitter. Hence, shifting part of the playback buffering delay at the UE to the base station nearly degrades the playout quality of VoD services. Mathematical analyses for power saving ratios of the regular DRX and the proposed traffic regulation plus time slicing mechanisms are given in this paper. Analytical results show that the proposed traffic regulation plus time slicing scheme reduces power consumption of UEs much more effectively, compared with the regular DRX mechanism.","2165-8536","978-1-4673-9991-3","10.1109/ICUFN.2016.7536933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536933","DRX;LTE-A;power saving;time slicing;traffic regulation;video-on-demand (VoD);wireless cellular networks","Base stations;Power demand;Delays;Videos;Bandwidth;Jitter;Mathematical model","cellular radio;jitter;Long Term Evolution;smart phones;telecommunication traffic;video on demand","traffic regulation-plus-time slicing scheme;power saving;video-on-demand services;power consumption reduction;smart phones;DRX-based LTE networks;DRX-based LTE-A networks;VoD services;regulation buffer allocation;base station;user equipments;DRX sleep cycle;DRX idle cycle;playback buffering delay;network jitter compensation;playout quality degradation;wireless cellular networks","","1","","15","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

RAN slicing involves the division of network resources into many logical segments where each segment has specific QoS and can serve users of the mobile virtual network operator(MVNO) with these requirements. This allows the Network Operator(NO) to provide service to multiple MVNOs each with different service requirements. Efficient allocation of the available resources to slices becomes vital in determining the number of users and therefore, number of MVNOs that a NO can support. In this work, we study the problem of Modulation and Coding Scheme(MCS) aware RAN slicing(MaRS) in the context of a wireless system having MVNOs which have users with minimum data rate requirement. Channel Quality Indicator(CQI) report sent from each user in the network determines the MCS selected, which in turn determines the achievable data rate. But the channel conditions might not remain the same for the entire duration of a user being served. For this reason, we consider the channel conditions to be dynamic where the choice of MCS level varies at each time instant. We model the MaRS problem as a Non-Linear Programming problem and show that it is NP-Hard. Next, we propose a solution based on the greedy algorithm paradigm. We then develop an upper performance bound for this problem and finally evaluate the performance of the proposed solution by comparing it against the upper bound under various channel and network configurations.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3108145","DARPA(grant numbers:HR0011-19-C-0096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524327","5G and Beyond Networks;RAN Slicing;Dynamic Channel Conditions;Performance Bound.","Internet of Things;Resource management;Quality of service;Computer architecture;5G mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless communication","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our idea is to partition a DCI into non-overlapped subgraphs, divide the VNT slicing in each subgraph into four collaborative steps, and get tenants involved in the calculation of virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes. With our proposal, an agent of infrastructure provider (InP) leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to price, and advertise the substrate resources in one subgraph, motivates tenants to request resources in a load-balanced manner, and accepts VNE schemes from the tenants to avoid resource conflicts. Meanwhile, the tenants' task is to compute their own VNE schemes independently, and distributedly according to the resource information (i.e., the available resources, and their prices) advertised by the agent. We first design the DRL model based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and develop a VNT compression method based on auto-encoder (AE) to generalize the DRL's operation. Then, we study how to resolve resource conflicts among the distributedly-calculated VNE schemes, build a conflict graph (CG) to transform the VNE selection into finding the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in the CG, and design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the problem. Extensive simulations confirm that compared with the centralized service framework relying solely on the InP for VNE calculation, our proposed DRL-assisted distributed framework provisions VNT requests with significantly shorter computation time, and comparable blocking performance.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3023693","NSFC Project(grant numbers:61871357,61771445,61701472); Zhejiang Lab Research Fund(grant numbers:2019LE0AB01); Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Project(grant numbers:QYZDY-SSW-JSC003); SPR Program of CAS(grant numbers:XDC02070300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195739","Auto-encoder (AE);datacenter interconnections (DCIS);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);distributed and parallel operation;virtual network embedding (VNE)","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Substrates;Topology;Pricing;Approximation algorithms;Virtualization","approximation theory;computer centres;computer networks;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;resource allocation;virtualisation","DRL-assisted service framework;datacenter interconnections;cost-effectiveness;time-efficiency;nonoverlapped subgraphs;VNT slicing;InP;deep reinforcement learning;substrate resources;load-balanced manner;resource information;DRL model;deep deterministic policy gradient;VNT compression method;polynomial-time approximation algorithm;centralized service framework;shorter computation time;DCI;conflict graph;maximum weighted independent set;MWIS;DDPG;tenant-driven virtual network slicing","","","","46","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network slicing is a promising technique for supporting M2M traffic on 6G networks as there is a need to concurrently support varying Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of M2M devices. A major bottleneck for M2M traffic is the Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure, which has to be performed for all devices, which results in the same latency for all service types. Due to the event-driven simultaneous access behavior of M2M devices, this procedure can cause severe congestion. Legacy congestion control schemes such as Access Class Barring (ACB) are not adequate to handle the overload in bursty traffic scenarios, which can happen frequently in M2M communications. There is also no clear guideline to adjust ACB parameters dynamically in such situations. Here we propose a multi-rate ACB algorithm using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tune the barring rates of different service classes. Our priority-based algorithm not only reduces the congestion but also slices the RACH among different service types. Comprehensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm maximizes the RACH utilization. In the meantime, based on each service priority, it reduces the delays and increases the access probability even when the connection requests exceed the RACH capacity.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473684","Reinforcement Learning (RL);RAN Slicing;Massive Machine Type Communication;Congestion Control;Access Class Barring (ACB)","6G mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Machine-to-machine communications;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Simulation;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","11","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel type of features - hybrid deep features, for scene images. Specifically, we exploit both object-based and scene-based features at two levels: part image level (i.e., parts of an image) and whole image level (i.e., a whole image), which produces a total number of four types of deep features. Regarding the part image level, we also propose two new slicing techniques to extract part based features. Finally, we aggregate these four types of deep features via the concatenation operator.

The techniques to efficiently allocate the available radio resources to different slices based on their requirements and their priority, also known as inter-slice radio resource management, has been the subject of many studies. The formerly proposed algorithms either assume the slices request maximum contracted data rates or they react passively as the demands arrive. This paper proposes to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to learn the pattern of the traffic demand of each network slices and predict the demands in the next decision interval. Based on the prediction of the slices' demands, a novel model for elastic inter-slice radio resource management is proposed to increase the multiplexing gain while not compromising the quality of offered connectivity services to the slices.

In this work, we first present a reference architecture for NS management and its brokering layer that enables NS discovery and dynamic composition. We detail the designs of the main NS brokering components, i.e., NS information model and NS request handling, which address some unique challenges of multi-domain NS brokering.

However, due to the introduction of NS into radio access networks (RAN) forming a UE-BS-NS three-layer association, handoff becomes very complicated and cannot be resolved by conventional policies. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handoff policy with data Sharing, named LESS, to reduce handoff cost while maintaining user QoS requirements in RAN slicing. Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761736","","Quality of service;Switches;Radio access networks;Distributed databases;Network architecture;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth","learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication computing","handoff mechanism;future mobile networks;extremely diverse communication requirements;UE-BS-NS;three-layer association;conventional policies;handoff cost;user QoS requirements;RAN slicing;action space;multiple users;data sparsity problem;user mobility;modified distributed Q-learning algorithm;handoff decisions;data sharing mechanism;LESS mechanism;target base station;traditional handoff policies;smart handoff policy;tailored quality of service;multiagent reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing","","6","","12","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional TCP/IP-based networks (e.g. Internet) will be transformed into SDN/NFV-enabled networks in the foreseeable future. Through virtualization, the slicing of heterogeneous underlying resources will provide an agile and customized virtual network (VN) services to end users. Hence, the virtual network function (VNF) embedding and scheduling are crucial to the VN service deployment in the SDN/NFV-enabled networks. In this paper, the dynamic VNF embedding and scheduling are jointly researched for enhancing the VN service provisioning. At first, the VNF embedding and scheduling are formulated by using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, having the goals of minimizing the consumed underlying resources and providing QoS-guaranteed VN service. Subsequently, to remove the NP-hardness of the MILP model, a dynamic VNF embedding and scheduling algorithm is proposed. For instance, when a new VN service is requested, the VNFs, constituting the service function chain (SFC) of the VN service, will be embedded and scheduled by the proposed algorithm. If the resource and QoS requirements of the VNFs are not satisfied, a re-embedding and re-scheduling scheme will be triggered in order to optimize certain existing VNFs. The dynamic embedding and scheduling algorithm has flexible network function placement and improves the underlying resource utilization.

Matching-based detection methods extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching. Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives) and high precision (91.95% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the capability of our method.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050051","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1836209,61802413); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China(grant numbers:19XNLG02,20XNLG03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316905","Vulnerable smart contracts;graph embedding;bytecode matching","Smart contracts;Task analysis;Interference;Blockchain;Prototypes;Business;Virtual machining","contracts;graph theory;pattern matching;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;unsupervised learning","matching-based detection methods;resultant financial losses;smart contract vulnerabilities;graph embedding;honeypot contracts;potentially vulnerable smart contracts;unsupervised graph;simulated bytecode executions;contract-specific slicing;instruction-level normalizations;bytecode matching;slicing techniques;homogeneous business logics;noise code;bytecode generation","","","","48","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a flexible RAN sharing architecture where a specific radio slice is allocated to each operator that shares the same RAN, while considering specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints. Secondly, we validate the proposed architecture via a simple radio resource allocation algorithm, which enables dynamic creation and configuration of radio slices, making it possible to transform on-the-fly a “Multi-Operator Core Network” (MOCN) sharing scenario, wherein the spectrum is shared by multiple operators, into a “Multi-Operator RAN” (MORAN) scenario, wherein the spectrum is isolated among the operators that share the same RAN.

In addition, we consider the bandwidth resource occupancy rate and the required resource size, and develop a dynamic resource pricing model to ensure the quality of user experience. Under the condition of ensuring the basic rate of cellular users, we divide the cost minimization problem of V2V users transmission tasks into two subproblems: control of transmission power and allocation of slicing bandwidth resources. Then, we propose an Evolutionary Strategy-based Bandwidth Allocation (ESBA) algorithm to complete the transmission tasks within the tolerable delay, which can avoid local minima. Simulation results show that ESBA algorithm has good convergence, and reduce the cost of V2V users transmission tasks effectively.","2576-8565","978-4-88552-332-8","10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562500","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872044,61902029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562500","Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V);Network slicing;Resource allocation;Resource pricing;Power control","Cellular networks;Costs;Simulation;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Delays","","","","","","16","","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A fundamental problem in EON slicing (known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE)) is how to efficiently map a virtual network (VN) on a substrate EON characterized by elastic transponders and flexible grid. Since a number of 5G services will have strict latency requirements, the VNE problem in EONs must be solved while guaranteeing latency targets. In existing literature, latency has always been modeled as a constraint applied on the virtual links of the VN. In contrast, we argue in favor of an alternate modeling that constrains the latency of virtual paths. Constraining latency over virtual paths (vs. over virtual links) poses additional modeling and algorithmic challenges to the VNE problem, but allows us to capture end-to-end service requirements. In this paper, we first model latency in an EON by identifying the different factors that contribute to it. We formulate the VNE problem with latency guarantees as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and propose a heuristic solution that can scale to large problem instances. We evaluated our proposed solutions using real network topologies and realistic transmission configurations under different scenarios and observed that, for a given VN request, latency constraints can be guaranteed by accepting a modest increase in network resource utilization. Latency constraints instead showed a higher impact on VN blocking ratio in dynamic scenarios.","2643-3303","978-1-7281-2700-2","10.1109/ICNP.2019.8888056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8888056","","Substrates;Optical fiber networks;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Adaptive optics;Virtualization","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical receivers;resource allocation;synchronisation;telecommunication network topology;transponders;virtualisation","Virtual Network Embedding;path-based latency guarantees;Elastic Optical Network virtualization;5G network slicing;EON slicing;substrate EON;elastic transponders;VNE problem;virtual links;virtual paths;end-to-end service requirements;network topologies;latency constraints;network resource utilization;5G services;VN blocking ratio;integer linear program;ILP","","4","","65","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm is based upon dynamic nature of allocation, calculation of the value of time quantum which varies according to the state of queue along with the capability of executing ready processes arriving at the same or different time. The concept of multi-threading by using Dummy Thread is introduced to hold the added processes in the queue during all arrival time intervals respectively. The performance is compared with Optimum Dynamic Time Slicing Using Round Robin (ODTSRR) and the results revealed that the proposed algorithm is much better specifically in response time and turnaround time.

However, there is not much research on the negative impact of classification delay and misclassification. In particular, an application generating bursty traffic such as video streaming causes congestion during the classification, which degrades QoE due to a considerable classification delay. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called Progressive Slicing, which adaptively assigns the flow to multiple slices according to the state of the classifications. This new classification mechanism mitigates the classification delay by progressively isolating flows into the slices in the course of the classifications. In addition, multiple stages of classifications improve accuracy and enable more flexible application slicing based on the confidence scores. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple user scenarios on Android VMs. We show that this method improves search response time on Twitter by 35% compared to the slicing with a single classification even when the traffic of video applications coexists.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9348019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348019","Machine Learning;Network Slicing;Application Identification","Social networking (online);Network slicing;Blogs;Streaming media;Delays;Time factors;Quality of experience","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online);telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;video streaming;virtual machines","bursty traffic;video streaming;classification delay;classification mechanism;flexible application slicing;video applications;application identification;traffic encryption;encrypted traffic;machine learning;application-specific traffic management;progressive slicing;application-specific network slicing;QoE;Android VM;Twitter","","","","15","","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider a hierarchical offloading scenario, where vehicle tasks are allowed to execute in MEC servers, convergence servers or cloud servers. To reduce the cost of latency and energy, we optimize the communication and computation resource allocation problem.

To ensure the quality of this process, when preparing to change a program, developers must first identify the main consequences and risks of modifying the program locations they intend to change.

Finer-grained analyses such as slicing give more detailed impact sets which, however, are also even larger in size. While various impact-set reduction approaches have been proposed at different levels of granularity, the challenge persists as very-large impact sets are still produced, impeding the adoption of impact analysis due to the great costs of inspecting those impact sets. To address these challenges, we present a novel dynamic-analysis technique called SensA which combines sensitivity analysis and execution differencing. SensA not only provides fine-grained (statement-level) impact sets but also prioritizes potential impacts via semantic-dependence quantification for program slices. We evaluated the benefits of impact prioritization using SensA with respect to static and dynamic forward slicing via an extensive empirical study of open-source Java applications and three case studies. Our results show that SensA can offer much better cost-effectiveness than slicing in assisting developers with impact inspection and fault cause-effect understanding.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2015.2481000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7287799","Dependence quantification;execution differencing;impact prediction;impact prioritization;sensitivity analysis","Semantics;History;Software;Syntactics;Sensitivity analysis;Inspection","Java;program slicing;sensitivity analysis","open-source Java applications;forward slicing;impact prioritization;program slices;semantic-dependence quantification;execution differencing;sensitivity analysis;SensA;dynamic-analysis technique;semantic program-dependence quantification;change-impact analysis","","4","","90","","2 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we propose a smart feature extraction solution to analyze the characteristics of incoming requests together with the already deployed slices, and then automatically evaluates the request requirements to make appropriate decisions. Second, we design an online algorithm that controls the slice admission based on their priorities, the arrival and departure characteristics, and the available resources. To mitigate system overloading, our framework dynamically adjusts resources allocated to low priority slices, thereby reducing the dropping probability of new slice requests. The proposed algorithm offers outstanding advantages over traditional static approaches by automatically adapting the controller decisions to the system changes. Simulation results show that our framework significantly improves the resource utilization and reduces the slice request dropping probabilities up to 44% as compared to the baseline schemes.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2019.2952882","France-Singapore MERLION 2017-2018, Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906,WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier(grant numbers:1 2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015- NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWTEP003- 041); 5G-MoNArch project(grant numbers:761445); Phase II of the 5th Generation Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) program partially; European Commission within the Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896931","Network slicing;reinforcement learning;admission and congestion control","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Noise measurement;Computer architecture","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network planning","slice request dropping probabilities;online algorithm;arrival characteristics;departure characteristics;5G services;5G networks;cross-slice admission;network slicing;slice deployment;artificial intelligence framework;resource utilization;controller decisions;low priority slices;smart feature extraction solution;operator revenue;storage resources;congestion control","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes Spectrum Slicing Coalition Formation (SSCF) protocol, a novel solution to address effective spectrum slicing required to meet the dynamic data demands at every 5G base station. The base stations' cooperation is formulated as a coalition formation game with overlapping coalitions, where a base station's contribution is not restricted to a single coalition, instead a base station participates intelligently in multiple coalitions. The SSCF protocol enables a base station to dynamically slice and share its allocated spectrum to service its load based spectral requirements, a key requirement for effective radio access network softwarization. The study explores operator base stations' options to determine with whom, when, and how much to slice and share the spectrum and the payoffs. Extensive simulations using real-world operator base station deployments highlight that SSCF solution brings in operational efficiencies, improved users' quality of experience, and revenue maximization.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2908903","Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680670","Spectrum slicing;inter-operator spectrum sharing;overlapping coalitional game;spectral efficiency;radio access network softwarization;user QoE improvement","Base stations;Quality of experience;5G mobile communication;Games;Heating systems;Protocols;Load modeling","5G mobile communication;game theory;protocols;radio access networks;radio spectrum management","overlapping Coalition Formation approach;Mobile Network Operators;upcoming 5G network deployments;efficient spectrum sharing;optimized spectrum partitioning;spectrum utilization;Spectrum Slicing Coalition Formation protocol;effective spectrum slicing;dynamic data demands;coalition formation game;overlapping coalitions;base station participates;SSCF protocol;allocated spectrum;spectral requirements;effective radio access network softwarization;operator base stations;operational efficiencies;real-world operator base station deployments;mobile user data demands","","5","","51","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid advances in machine learning and scanning, early detection of AD may be possible via computer-assisted systems using neuroimaging data. Among all, deep learning utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a prominent tool due to its capability to extract high-level features through local connectivity, weight sharing, and spatial invariance. This paper describes our investigation of the classification accuracy based on two publicly available data sets, namely, ADNI and OASIS, by building a 3D VGG variant convolutional network (CNN). We used 3D models to avoid information loss, which occurs during the process of slicing 3D MRI into 2D images and analyzing them by 2D convolutional filters.

These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals.

Consequentially, the latency impact of radio resource management on the end-to-end latency is optimized in this work by using so-called Configured Grants (CGs), which aim to minimize latency-intensive scheduling requests by pre-allocating radio resources. As predicting future traffic demands and channel conditions are required to use CGs, a data-driven machine learning-based radio resource scheduler prototype is introduced and evaluated in this work based on a specifically developed 5G radio resource simulator.

In such an environment, we are particularly interested in supervising network slicing, a recent tool enabling to create multiple virtual networks for different applications and QoS constraints on a Telco infrastructure. The goal is to infer the underlay resources states from the measurements performed in the overlay structure. We model the inference task as a regression problem that we solve following a Neural Network approach. Since getting labeled data for the training phase can be costly, our procedure generates artificial data for the training phase. By creating a large set of random training examples, the Neural Network learns the relations between the measures done at path and link levels. This approach takes advantage of efficient Machine Learning solutions to solve a classic inference problem. Simulations with a public dataset show very promising results compared to statistical-based methods. We explored mainly additive metrics such as delays or logs of loss rates, but the approach can also be used for non-additive ones such as bandwidth.","2331-9860","978-1-7281-3893-0","10.1109/CCNC46108.2020.9045301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045301","","Monitoring;Measurement;Tomography;Training;Network topology;Neural networks;Overlay networks","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;overlay networks;quality of service;regression analysis;software defined networking;virtualisation","TOM;Network tomography;internal network characteristics;end-to-end correlated measurements;link metrics inference;network slicing;multiple virtual networks;neural network approach;training phase;classic inference problem;self-trained tomography solution;SDN-NFV environment;tomography for overlay network monitoring;QoS constraints;Telco infrastructure;regression problem;artificial data generation;statistical-based methods;machine learning;additive metrics","","1","","20","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such approaches to the design of EDMs have invariably adopted a fault model with a single-fault assumption, limiting the relevance of the detectors and their evaluation. Software containing more than a single fault is commonplace, with safety standards recognizing that critical failures are often the result of unlikely or unforeseen combinations of faults. This paper addresses this shortcoming, demonstrating that it is possible to generate efficient EDMs under simultaneous fault models. In particular, it is shown that (i) efficient EDMs can be designed using fault injection data collected under models accounting for the occurrence of simultaneous faults, (ii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can yield improved EDM efficiency, (iii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can be made non-exhaustive and (iv) EDMs can be relocated within a software system using program slicing, reducing the resource costs of experimentation to practicable levels without sacrificing EDM efficiency.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266977","detection;error;model;location;machine learning","","","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

On the other hand, the development of neural networks and deep learning in many fields has led researchers to consider the possibility of applying them to solve the program synthesis problems. In this paper, we took the probabilistic program synthesis realized by the neural network as the research subject and noticed that most of the current work borrows from the structure of encoding and decoding in natural language processing. We analyzed its two possible disadvantages, one is the performance degradation of the long-sequence structure, the other is that synthesized results without validation are too redundant. We took a probabilistic encoder-decoder neural model named BAYOU as an example to analyze the specific problem. We proposed a framework named PASS which contains several methods to solve those problems and improve the model performance. For the former problem, we showed how to adapt neural networks to increase the attention mechanism to address the problem of information forgetting and long sequences unmanageable. Then, we combined the program slicing in the field of program analysis to slice the generated program, thereby eliminated redundant code of result from methods without validation and had a more refined result. The experiment showed that the accuracy of neural program synthesis guided from our approach improved by a mean of 17%, up to a maximum of 22%. Besides, the slicing work of our approach succeeded in a mean about code refinement rate of 25.3% for those methods without result validation.","0730-3157","978-1-7281-7303-0","10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.0-146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9202721","Program Synthesis;Attention Mechanism;Program Slice","Decoding;Neural networks;Probabilistic logic;Task analysis;Programming;Search problems;Machine learning","formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;program diagnostics;program slicing","neural program synthesis;attention mechanism;program slicing;programming language;neural network;program synthesis problems;probabilistic program synthesis;probabilistic encoder-decoder neural model;program analysis;BAYOU;long-sequence structure;PASS","","","","29","","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent emergencies related to immigration revealed the substantial inefficiency of conventional means of border patrolling based on warships, coast guard speedboats and helicopters. A reliable technical answer to these emergency problems may come from the use of different kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These flying vehicles may allow at improving border control. Nevertheless, such technologies require significant amount of personnel, energy and infrastructure to properly serve border protection. In order to be really effective, UAVs should autonomously cooperate in networked manner, collecting information from the on-ground and/or water-surface sensors, exchanging data among them and conveying the critical information to remote border control centres. This is the main objective of DAVOSS project (Dynamic Architectures based on UAVs Monitoring for border Security and Safety), funded by NATO in the framework of the Science for Peace and Security Programme. This paper aims at presenting the novel adaptive and virtualized aerospace network architecture proposed in DAVOSS. The leading concepts of DAVOSS are flexibility, dynamic reconfigurability, energy efficiency and broadband connection availability also in critical application scenarios. In order to improve robustness and resilience of the avionic network and to enable the efficient information backhaul also in absence of terrestrial links, advanced networking and communications technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), network slicing and virtualization are introduced. System requirements, coming from potential end-users, along with real application scenarios will be carefully analyzed in order to drive the architectural design phase, whose preliminary outcomes will be shown in the paper.

The aim is to reap the benefits of statistical multiplexing resulting from flexible sharing of `pooled' resources, while enabling tenants to differentiate and protect their performance from one another's load fluctuations. To that end we consider a setting where resources are grouped into Virtual Resource Pools (VRPs) wherein resource allocation is jointly and dynamically managed. Specifically for each VRP we adopt a Share-Constrained Proportionally Fair (SCPF) allocation scheme where each tenant is allocated a fixed share (budget). This budget is to be distributed equally amongst its active customers which in turn are granted fractions of their associated VRP resources in proportion to customer shares. For a VRP with a single resource, this translates to the well known Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. For VRPs with multiple resources SCPF provides a flexible means to achieve load elastic allocations across tenants sharing the pool. Given tenants' per resource shares and expected loads, this paper formulates the problem of determining optimal VRP partitions which maximize the overall expected shared weighted utility while ensuring protection guarantees. For a high load/capacity setting we exhibit this network utility function explicitly, quantifying the benefits and penalties of any VRP partition, in terms of network slices' ability to achieve performance differentiation, load balancing, and statistical multiplexing. Although the problem is shown to be NP-Hard, a simple greedy heuristic is shown to be effective. Analysis and simulations confirm that the selection of optimal VRP partitions provide a practical avenue towards improving network utility in network slicing scenarios with dynamic loads.","","978-3-903176-20-1","10.23919/WiOPT47501.2019.9144143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144143","","Resource management;Wireless networks;Network slicing;Base stations;Multiplexing;Dynamic scheduling","cloud computing;greedy algorithms;multiplexing;optimisation;resource allocation;statistical analysis","network slicing scenarios;dynamic loads;generalized processor sharing policy;load balancing;network slices;VRP partition;network utility function;expected shared weighted utility;optimal VRP partitions;expected loads;resource shares;load elastic allocations;multiple resources;single resource;customer shares;associated VRP resources;active customers;fixed share;Fair allocation scheme;virtual resource pools;load fluctuations;flexible sharing;statistical multiplexing resulting;dynamic customer loads;resource allocation;virtual resource pool partitioning;optimizing network","","","","37","","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper defines and outlines a multivariate trust model in an SDN environment that provides a method to implement the policies of a complex organization. An entity's trust level, based on hardware trusted platform modules, operating system status, user identification, and traffic patterns, is used to determine whether its particular traffic flow is allowed to traverse the network. Ultimately, we allocate a dynamic network slicing solution to such flows, enabling the efficient allocation of bandwidth across a layered SDN.

The model is composed of a μO slice, which delivers a venue with customized wireless services tailored to the its local service requirements, and an MNO slice, which facilitates improved wireless coverage to visitors/end-users with subscriptions to several different MNOs. The NH-μO is not biased to favor any specific client, which can be enforced through a concrete commercial agreement. A radio access network slicing concept is exploited to support and optimize both the slice instances (SIs) efficiently in a shared manner on a single physical network infrastructure. In addition, we devise an efficient architecture for the NH-μO small cell base station and dynamic spectrum assignment control unit, and their required functionalities supporting sustainable coexistence of different SIs in shared spectrum. We also devise both interSI and intra-SI dynamic spectrum allocation policies considering time-varying requirements of different SIs. These policies take care of application level priority by providing a proper mixture of users with guaranteed quality of service and best-effort users, while ensuring a healthy SI competition. The advantages of the proposed framework are twofold. It enables the venue owner to manage its wireless networks and consider its very specific requirements while capitalizing from the MNO slice. This, in turn, reduces the need for deployment of new infrastructure while providing improved wireless coverage and savings to MNOs.

Given this context, it is essential to ensure that service KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are adhered to through timely detection of fault or performance issues to enable resolution in accordance with the use case's requirements. The monitoring framework should thus enable timely detection of fault or performance issues based on service/slice KPIs under dynamic network conditions, taking into consideration user characteristics, location and other relevant criteria. This paper presents a context-aware and adaptive network data collection, aggregation and analysis framework for effective fault or performance anomaly-detection based on context (location, user and service/slice characteristics, environment factors), dynamic network conditions and service/slice target KPIs.

Security is regarded as a technology independent of the cloud native architecture in the initial design, traditional passive defense such as “reinforced” and “stacked” is relied on to achieve system security protection. The lack of intrinsic security mechanisms makes the system capability insufficient when faces the uncertain threat brought by vulnerabilities and backdoors under the ecosystem of opening-up and sharing. The static nature of existing networks and computing systems makes them easy to be compromised and hard to defend, and thus it is urgent to provide intrinsic security and proactive protection against the unpredictable attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel paradigm named intrinsic cloud security (iCS) from the perspective of dynamic defense. The dynamic defense provides component-level security, and has complementary and consistency with the cloud native environment. In particular, iCS introduces mimic defense and moving target defense (MTD), and makes full use of the new features introduced by cloud native to implement an intrinsic and proactive defense mechanism with acceptable costs and efficiency. The iCS paradigm achieves seamless integration and symbiosis evolution between security and cloud native. We implement a trial of iCS based on 5GC commercial system and evaluate its performance on costs, efficiency and attack success. The result shows that the iCS enhanced mode always can provide a better and more stable defense effects.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3071774","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1804705); Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2020C01077,2021C01036,2020C01021); Major Scientific Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2018FD0ZX01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399165","Cyber security;MTD;mimic defense;cloud native;network functions virtualization (NFV);software defined network (SDN);network slicing","Security;Cloud computing;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Ecosystems;Symbiosis;Computer science","","","","1","","46","IEEE","8 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Future 5G applications will impose strict latency and dynamicity requirements on the Edge Cloud, in intra- and inter-data center networks. The Edge Cloud needs a network infrastructure able to deliver: low latency (~microseconds), deterministic data delivery in time (~nanoseconds jitter), and dynamic reconfiguration (~milliseconds) between objects (antennas, robots) in data centers or across data centers, through a fronthaul network. In this paper, we propose, implement, and demonstrate a deterministic dynamic network based Edge Cloud network.

However, negotiating resources in a reactive manner can bring risks to the tenants due to traffic variations, and can also limit the gain in terms of spectral efficiency for the infrastructure provider. In this paper, we focus on how to exploit anticipatory strategies relying on predicted information on users' conditions in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed dynamic network slicing and trading framework.

Given a bug report, a developer may spend tremendous time comprehending the bug description together with code in order to locate bugs. To facilitate bug report comprehension, information retrieval (IR)-based bug localization techniques have been proposed to automatically search for and rank potential buggy code elements (i.e., classes or methods). However, these techniques do not leverage any dynamic execution information of buggy programs. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study on how dynamic execution information can help with static IR-based bug localization. More specifically, with the fixing patches and bug reports of 157 real bugs, we investigated the impact of various execution information (i.e. coverage, slicing, and spectrum) on three IR-based techniques: the baseline technique, BugLocator, and BLUiR. Our experiments demonstrate that both the coverage and slicing information of failed tests can effectively reduce the search space and improve IR-based techniques at both class and method levels. Using additional spectrum information can further improve bug localization at the method but not the class level. Some of our investigated ways of augmenting IR-based bug localization with execution information even outperform a state-of-the-art technique, which merges spectrum with an IR-based technique in a complicated way. Different from prior work, by investigating various easy-to-understand ways to combine execution information with IR-based techniques, this study shows for the first time that execution information can generally bring considerable improvement to IR-based bug localization.","","978-1-5386-0535-6","10.1109/ICPC.2017.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961521","","Computer bugs;Tools;Instruments;Computer science;History;Runtime;Tuning","information retrieval;program debugging;program slicing;program testing","information-retrieval based bug localization;bug description;bug report comprehension;rank potential buggy code elements;dynamic execution information;static IR-based bug localization;IR-based technique;baseline technique;BugLocator;BLUiR;IR-based techniques;spectrum information","","6","","36","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A dynamic CDN slice is deployed to cache content at optimal locations depending on the nature of the content and the geographical distributions of potential viewers. Virtual cache servers, along with supporting virtual transcoders, are placed across a cloud belonging to multiple-administrative domains, forming a CDN slice. The ICN slice is, in turn, used for the regional distribution of content, leveraging the name-based access and the autonomic in-network content caching. This enables the delivery of content from nearby network nodes,avoiding the duplicate transfer of content and also ensuring shorter response times.

Though semi-automated and fully automated methods have been developed for left ventricular segmentation, they suffer from a number of drawbacks. These drawbacks include the dependence on large sets of training data and assumptions about the distribution of the intensities of the image. This paper proposes a novel volumetric segmentation algorithm based on an angular slicing approach for 3-D echocardiography scans and a diffeomorphic nonrigid registration method. The proposed method is fast, reproducible, and yields a volumetric segmentation with minimal user interaction. The algorithm was evaluated on 30 participants from the challenge on endocardial 3-D ultrasound segmentation dataset from the medical image computing and computer assisted interventions Challenge 2014. The proposed method yielded the following average distance metrics for the end diastolic volumes: 1) mean absolute distance of 2.36 mm, 2) Hausdorff distance of 8.25 mm, and 3) Dice score of 0.887.

Such a QoS policy allows the flexible allocation of Resource Blocks (RBs) considering the entire spectrum for individual services, while a dynamic resource variation additionally allocates temporarily unused RBs to particular slices in need.

The packet duplication (PD) technique has been proposed as a promising solution to satisfy the extreme requirements of URLLC services. However, the benefit of PD comes at the cost of doubling resource usage. This paper investigates how to efficiently perform end-to-end URLLC slicing based on PD in 5G optical transport networks. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed, including PD-based slicing with wavelength isolation (PDS-WI) and PD-based slicing with link isolation (PDS-LI). The target of this paper is to maximize the number of accommodated URLLC slices by optimizing the allocation of heterogenous resources. The time complexity of these two algorithms is analyzed in detail. With dynamic slice requests, simulations are performed to evaluate and compare their performance in terms of slice blocking probability and resource usage. Meanwhile, two different network scenarios are considered in simulation.

Firstly, it supports the developer's short term memory by providing a summary of relevant program state and context for the current instruction. Secondly, it provides an alternative to breakpoints as it can be used to control the debugger to jump to related instructions, such as the last change of a variable. Thirdly, it allows to directly reconfigure the slicing criteria, enabling the developer to minimize the search space of active code without interrupting the debugging workflow. The paper focuses on the UI and implementation of the Slice Navigator view and how it changes the debugging workflow.

We propose centralized and distributed architectures for collaboration between network service provider (NSP), video service provider (VSP), and users (DASH clients) to provide NSP-managed or VSP-managed DASH services over software-defined networks (SDN) with quality-of-service (QoS) reserved network slices. We show that QoS reservation alone is not sufficient to overcome QoE fluctuations per client and unfairness between heterogeneous video clients, and clients also need to employ TCP receive-window adaptation knowing their fair-share bitrate. To this effect, we propose two collaborative streaming service models to inform clients about their fair-share bitrates. We first present an NSP-managed service model with centralized collaboration between the NSP, VSP, and the users, where a traffic engineering manager at the NSP assigns a fair-share bitrate to each DASH client. We then present a VSP-managed service model with centralized or distributed collaboration architectures, where in the former the VSP determines the fair-share bitrate for each client over a reserved network slice and in the latter a group of DASH clients sharing a reserved network slice collaborate among themselves. In the novel distributed collaboration framework, collaboration groups are identified by the VSP, and clients within a group share critical parameters with each other so that each client can estimate its fair-share bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that collaboration rather than competition between clients not only helps them achieve a smooth goodput near their fair-share bitrate, but also improves the total goodput over the reserved slice.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2736638","TUBITAK Project(grant numbers:115E299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8006313","Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH);QoE fairness;QoE fluctuations;software-defined networks (SDN);transmission control protocol (TCP)","Streaming media;Bit rate;Collaboration;Quality of service;Throughput;Video recording","quality of service;software defined networking;transport protocols","DASH client;TCP receive-window adaptation;QoS reservation;quality-of-service;SDN;software-defined networks;network service provider;video service provider;QoE;HTTP;dynamic adaptive streaming;collaborative DASH video","","14","","35","Traditional","9 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we formulate a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) based optimization problem to maximize the sum goodput of eMBB users while satisfying URLLC and eMBB users' QoS requirements. The proposed scheme considers the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and the active user's queue status for the dynamic assignment of radio resources to the heterogeneous users according to its demand.

In this paper, a two-dimension-time-scale hierarchical resource allocation scheme is proposed in the multi-service wireless virtualized network, which consists of three 5G generic scenarios. The resource slicing problem is decomposed into two time scales including large time period for inter-slice resource pre-allocation and small time slot for intra-slice resource scheduling. In large time period, the inter-slice resource pre-allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) by modeling the packets arriving and serving process of each slice as a queueing system. While in small time slot, the resource block (RB) and power scheduling in each slice is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem considering dynamic traffic arrivals and time-varying channel conditions, which is aimed at optimizing the overall performance subject to various quality of service (QoS) requirements such as network stability, delay, reliability, transmission rate and power constraints. The stochastic optimization problem can be transformed into a delay-aware optimization problem by applying Lyapunov optimization technique, and be solved by the proposed algorithm consisting of a heuristic algorithm and a concave optimization algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes are close to the optimal solution with a lower complexity, which can also achieve a performance-delay tradeoff related to the control factor.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3019217","National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2018ZX030110004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701037,61932005); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B16006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174927","Lyapunov optimization;multi-objective optimization problem;resource allocation;wireless network virtualization","Optimization;Resource management;Wireless networks;Heuristic algorithms;Scheduling;5G mobile communication","optimisation;quality of service;radio networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;time-varying channels;virtualisation;wireless channels","different virtual networks;future wireless networks;two-dimension-time-scale hierarchical resource allocation scheme;multiservice wireless virtualized network;resource slicing problem;time scales;time period;time slot;intra-slice resource scheduling;inter-slice resource pre-allocation problem;multiobjective optimization problem;power scheduling;stochastic optimization problem;dynamic traffic arrivals;time-varying channel conditions;service requirements;network stability;delay-aware optimization problem;multiservice wireless networks;wireless network virtualization;data service demands;spectrum resources;wireless resources","","1","","45","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An adaptive shortwave communication is considered as an effective method while channel quality estimation (CQE) is essential for the shortwave adaptive communication system. Currently, deep learning (DL) based CQE methods are proposed to achieve a good identification performance. However, existing methods are hard to extract full features from baseband signals, due to the fact that their deep neural networks are trained from the limited length of signal samples. In order to avoid this problem, we consider two training models. The first one is transforming baseband signals into constellation diagrams and three kinds of DL algorithms (i.e., AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet) are applied respectively for training. The second one is slicing IQ signals into multi-slices signals and convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied and CQE is a joint multi-slice and cooperative decision. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are robust, and joint multi-slice and cooperative detection aided DL-based CQE method achieves better performance even up to 100%.","2472-7628","978-1-7281-7236-1","10.1109/WCSP49889.2020.9299767","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299767","Channel quality estimation (CQE);shortwave adaptive communication;deep learning (DL);convolutional neural network (CNN)","Channel estimation;Constellation diagram;Feature extraction;Adaptive systems;Training;Estimation;Channel models","channel estimation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;wireless channels","CQE method;deep learning-based channel quality estimation;adaptive shortwave communication systems;channel quality;frequency resources;shortwave adaptive communication system;baseband signals;deep neural networks;training models;IQ signals;multislices signals;convolutional neural network","","","","31","","28 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with the complex requirements of the modern networks, a sudden re-configuration of a network is often required. Modern applications require the configuration of networks on a fly and according to dynamically changing requirements, but the conventional solutions need to configure each and every device locally. The real time requirements are dynamic and the conventional network configuration is static in nature. SDN provides a better option by enabling the programmable interfaces on network hardware and a centralized control. Based on an emulated topology, this paper presents the physical and logical topology slicing under a centralised control by using SDN with no need of the local configuration of network elements.","","978-1-4673-8721-7","10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7726827","SDN;physical;logical;slicing;network complexity","Topology;Network topology;Complexity theory;Bandwidth;Ports (Computers);Organizations;Industries","computer network security;telecommunication network topology","physical topology slicing;logical topology slicing;SDN;computer networks;software defined networks;data privacy;programmable interface;network hardware;centralized control","","7","","7","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid development of investigation, deep learning such as deep forest regression (DFR) have been applied. However, for high-dimension datasets, these methods usually can't implement better effects and high time cost. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-sliced sampling-based DFR (Mss-DFR) model is proposed to solve the above problems in high-dimension datasets. The improved model is different from the original model in three important aspects. Firstly, considering the diversity and time cost of sub-forest, the raw feature vector is segmented into three parts through multi slicing strategy. Further, based on the mutual information feature selection model, the optimized feature set is obtained that according to the principle of minimum redundancy and maximum correlation, and then combined with the layer regression vector. Finally, consider variance can projection effect the difference of each sub-forest in DFR, so that it added to the layer regression vector.

This will equip ISPs with cutting-edge technologies to provide service customization during service delivery and offer QoE which meets customers' needs via intelligent QoE control and management approaches.

As a recent and relevant example, deployments of 5G communication networks will soon enter their second phase, during which the network infrastructure will require upgrades to support new Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) services with availabilities of up to 6 nines to be guaranteed jointly with extremely low latencies. Even in the still preliminary vision of 6G communication networks, reliability is posed as one of the most critical requirements, as 6G networks will represent the communication platform of our future hyper-connected society, supporting essential services as smart mobility, e-health, and immersive environments with application in remote education and working, just to name a few. Similarly, disaster resiliency in communication networks is now attracting the attention of media, government and industry as never before (consider, e.g., the worldwide network traffic deluge to support remote working during the current Coronavirus pandemic). Luckily, several new technical directions can be leveraged to provide new solutions for network reliability as: increased network reconfigurability enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN); integration/convergence of multiple technologies (optical, wireless satellite, datacenter networks); enhanced forms of data/service replication, supported by, e.g., edge computing; network slicing, used to carve highly-reliable logical partitions of network, computing and storage resources.

With network slicing, 5G networks can be dynamically adapted to the different needs of specific vertical industries. This capability has opened the opportunity to new business models whereby infrastructure owners can monetize their investment by leasing resources to third parties (i.e. tenants). In this respect, a challenging task for the owner of the radio access network infrastructure (i.e. the network provider) is the spectrum planning of multi-tenant scenarios. This paper proposes different alternatives of hiring capacity to the provider as well as a set of spectrum planning strategies, each giving a certain degree of flexibility to allocate resources per tenant. These strategies are evaluated in a 5G small cell multi-tenant network through snapshot-based simulations. The performance of the strategies is assessed in terms of scalability, spectrum isolation, utilization and efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990802","H2020 Research and Innovation Project 5G-CLARITY(grant numbers:871428); Andalusian Knowledge Agency(grant numbers:A-TIC-241-UGR18); Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (FPU)(grant numbers:17/01844); Spanish Research Council and FEDER funds through SONAR 5G(grant numbers:TEC2017-82651-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9079548","5G networks;multi-tenancy;new radio;RAN slicing;small cells;spectrum planning","5G mobile communication;Planning;Resource management;Network slicing;Capacity planning;Scalability","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","network slicing;smart networks;fifth generation era;spectrum planning level;spectrum isolation;5G small cell multitenant network;spectrum planning strategies;multitenant scenarios;network provider;radio access network infrastructure;infrastructure owners;business models","","1","","54","CCBY","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network hypervisors are an in-between layer to allow multiple SDN controllers to share this control by slicing the network and giving each controller the power over a part of the network. This makes network hypervisors a critical component in terms of reliability and performance. At the same time, compute virtualization is ubiquitous and may not guarantee statically assigned resources to the network hypervisors. It is therefore important to understand the performance of network hypervisors in environments with varying compute resources. In this paper we propose an online machine learning pipeline to synthesize a performance model of a running hypervisor instance in the face of varying resources. The performance model allows precise estimations of the current capacity in terms of control message throughput without time-intensive offline benchmarks. We evaluate the pipeline in a virtual testbed with a popular network hypervisor implementation. The results show that the proposed pipeline is able to estimate the capacity of a hypervisor instance with a low error and furthermore is able to quickly detect and adapt to a change in available resources. By exploring the parameter space of the learning pipeline, we discuss its characteristics in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence time for different parameter choices and use cases. Although we evaluate the approach with network hypervisors, our work can be generalized to other latency-sensitive applications with similar characteristics and requirements as network hypervisors.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987462","","Virtual machine monitors;Adaptation models;Pipelines;Virtualization;Computational modeling;Radiation detectors;Estimation","computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;software defined networking;telecommunication control;virtualisation","network hypervisor performance models;software defined networking;SDN controller;logically centralized entity;real-time control;network forwarding state;network slicing;reliability;virtualization;online machine learning pipeline;control message throughput;virtual testbed;estimation accuracy;convergence time;latency-sensitive applications","","7","","23","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In developing countries, majority of primary-care is handled by unqualified practitioners owing to an acute shortage of doctors. The goal of this project is to develop a portable and low-cost system that can be used by untrained frontline health-workers for early detection of valvular heart abnormalities such as arrhythmias and murmurs. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud and Mobile, we simulated stethoscope-based cardiac auscultation typically done by trained doctors. We detect abnormal heartbeat patterns by applying pre-processing algorithms such as slicing and FFT to stethoscope sounds, converting into high-quality spectrograms and classifying with state-of-the-art Cloud-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained with normal and abnormal heart sounds.

Based on the findings from the initial analysis, we determine that the card is equipped with a “head and tail protection” mechanism. Second, a chosen-plaintext power analysis with a complexity of 2<sup>16</sup> is proposed, which is designed to recover the second round key from the power leakage in the third round. Then, a slicing-collision-algebraic attack is presented, which decreases the complexity to 2<sup>6</sup> rapidly.

Slice tenants such as virtual wireless operators, service providers or smart-city services will be able to book a share of the infrastructure, possibly including storage, computing capacity and link bandwidth. However, 5G slicing is attractive for infrastructure providers as long as they are able to generate revenues, while at once satisfying the tenants' competing and variable demands and coping with resources availability. This work proposes a flexible mechanism based on a multibidding scheme for 5G slice allocation. It is able to attain desirable fairness and efficiency figures in order to serve slice tenants and associated mobile users. Built on the notion of normalised Nash equilibrium, it is also provably overbookingfree even though the players' bids are oblivious to infrastructure resources constraints. Also, it is compatible with standard radio access schedulers used in modern mobile networks. Finally, a practical algorithm is proposed to drive the system to the socially-optimal operating point via an online procedure rooted on a primal-dual distributed algorithm.

The software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) rise as a promising solution to overcome such issues of traditional network architecture. In this paper, we introduce a new network architecture for LTE and WiFi slicing networks taking into account the advantage of SDN and NFV concepts. We propose an IP-Flow management controller in a slicing network to offload and balance the data traffic flow. By utilizing the P-GW and Wireless Access Gateway, we can handle the IP-Flow between LTE and WiFi networks. The P-GW works as an IP-Flow anchor to maintain the flow seamlessly during the offloading and balancing IP-Flow. Within WiFi networks, we leverage the Light Virtual Access Point (LVAP) approach to abstract the WiFi protocol stack for a programming capability of centralized control of WiFi network through the WiFi controller.

Two-fold are the advantages offered by this upgrade: i) enabling next generation services, and ii) allowing new profit opportunities. Many efforts exist already in the field of admission control, resource allocation and pricing for virtualized networks. Most of the 5G-related research efforts focus in technological enhancements for making existing solutions compliant to the strict requirements of next generation networks. On the other hand, the profit opportunities associated to the slice market also need to be reconsidered in order to assess the feasibility of this new business model. Nonetheless, when economic aspects are studied in the literature, technical constraints are generally oversimplified. For this reason, in this work, we propose an admission control mechanism for network slicing that respects 5G timeliness while maximizing network infrastructure providers' revenue, reducing expenditures and providing a fair slice provision to competing service providers. To this aim, we design an admission policy of reduced complexity based on bid selection, we study the optimal strategy in different circumstances (i.e., pool size of available resources, service providers' strategy and traffic load), analyze the performance metrics and compare the proposal against reference approaches. Finally, we explore the case where infrastructure providers lease network slices either on-demand or on a periodic time basis and provide a performance comparison between the two approaches. Our analysis shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing solutions, especially in the case of infrastructures with large pool of resources and under intense traffic conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939935","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (5GAuRA)(grant numbers:675806); Generalitat de Catalunya; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827482","Communication networks;5G mobile communication;network slicing;infrastructure as a service;traffic control;admission control;queuing analysis;Markov processes;pricing;profitability","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Admission control;Network slicing;Pricing","5G mobile communication;next generation networks;pricing;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","network slicing;network programmability paradigm;virtual network slices;virtualized networks;admission control mechanism;fair slice provision;5G networks;next generation networks","","1","","23","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework encompasses a novel hierarchical orchestration mechanism for mapping network slices onto physical resources and a mechanism for dynamic slice resizing. The main idea is to locally redefine the delay requirements on each network domain depending on the conditions in the rest of the network. Delays larger than threshold (debt) are allowed in certain domains if there is a possibility to compensate such excessive delays in other segments of the network that can transmit the messages with less latency (credit). This tradeoff or delay threshold redefinition on different segments of the route is referred to as network latency equalization. For performance comparison, minimum cost routing with latency constraints is used as a baseline. We show that our approach enables significantly better utilization of the network resources measured in the number of slices with the same latency requirements that can be accommodated in the network.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3008005","Finnish Academy/NSF U.S. collaborative program WiFi U.S. 2018; Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136770","Real-time applications;multi-domain network slicing;end-to-end network slicing;resource allocation;end-to-end latency;limited-latency networks","Delays;Network slicing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Routing;Topology","computer network management;equalisers;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing;virtualisation","network slicing;multiple virtual networks;delay-critical applications;multidomain network virtualization framework;mapping network slices;network domain;network latency equalization;hierarchical orchestration mechanism","","1","","36","IEEE","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, unpredictable network conditions, such as congestion and link quality, can severely degrade the quality of experience (QoE). While buffer-based mitigations cannot be applied to real-time applications due to their immediate resource needs, recent innovations in network slicing have demonstrated the feasibility of dedicating specified amounts of network resources to individual sessions in the radio access network. Encouraged by this, we propose to reserve network resources for multimedia sessions in real time according to their declared needs, thereby providing ad hoc session-level performance guarantees. Through Wi-Fi experiments and trace-driven LTE simulations, we show that such session-level resource provisioning is robust to real-time channel fluctuations and congestion externalities over the lifetime of a session. This approach, however, raises challenges: how can the network ensure that users are honest about their resource needs and optimally allocate its limited resources to users under uncertainty in future sessions' resource needs? We derive a novel multi-unit combinatorial auction (MUCA) model with a unique structure that can be exploited for fast winner determination, and yet incentivize truthful bidding, properties not simultaneously achieved in a generic MUCA but essential to making real-time session guarantees. Furthermore, since dynamic bidding in real time is challenging for end-users who are budget-constrained, we develop a reinforcement learning-based utility-maximizing strategy to distribute their budget across sessions and show that it yields high user utility.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2916487","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1751075); DARPA(grant numbers:HR001117C0048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732668","Quality of service;5G mobile communication;resource management;economics;machine learning;network slicing;auction theory;reinforcement learning;performance guarantees","Real-time systems;Streaming media;Quality of experience;Bit rate;Wireless communication;Long Term Evolution;Resource management","combinatorial mathematics;electronic commerce;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;multimedia communication;optimisation;quality of experience;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;video streaming;wireless LAN","procuring spontaneous session-level resource guarantees;real-time applications;auction approach;real-time multimedia applications;interactive gaming;live video streaming;bitrate requirements;unpredictable network conditions;link quality;network slicing;network resources;individual sessions;radio access network;multimedia sessions;ad hoc session-level performance guarantees;session-level resource provisioning;real-time channel fluctuations;congestion externalities;future sessions;novel multiunit combinatorial auction model;real-time session guarantees;Wi-Fi experiments;trace-driven LTE simulations;reinforcement learning-based utility-maximizing strategy","","4","","45","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study the system cost of two types of user groups requesting resource blocks (RBs) at the radio access network (RAN), which are the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) cellular user group and the cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X) user group. In order to improve the rational utilization, we make dynamic resource pricing according to the needs of users.

Users will have increasingly strict requirements for quality of service (QoS), e.g., a high rate, low latency, and low energy consumption. To address these problems, it is helpful to combine network slicing and mobile edge computing (MEC) to provide customized networks while reducing the service processing time. Due to the uncertainty of user requests and the environment, reasonable resource allocation is always particularly challenging. A novel dynamic resource allocation scheme for MEC slice systems, which formulates resource allocation and computation offloading issues as an optimization problem subject to the latency and rate, is proposed. Based on the dynamics of the slice requirements, quantity, and service time, the proposed problem is converted to a Markov decision process (MDP), and a state, action, and reward function are proposed. By exploiting the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the wireless resources and computing resources are configured dynamically according to the requirements of different types of slices to maximize the revenue of the network operator. The simulation results demonstrate the influence of the slice arrival rate and total resources on the allocation policy.

Clearly, for minimizing cloud access delay and maximizing cloud net profit, several mechanisms are considered in 5G Cloud era: migrating virtual cloud resources, redirecting incoming request, steering traffic via mobile edge computing (MEC), overselling virtual resources, etc. However, the first three mechanisms increase the cloud cost, but the fourth one may increase cloud reward. With general business policy of overselling, the dynamic Service License Agreements (SLAs) are required for achieving the objective. To maximize system reward while satisfying the QoS of various SLAs in 5G, an efficient cloud resource allocation is required for cloud manager. The Reward-based adaptive global Cloud Resource Management, namely RCRM, is thus proposed for 5G. Moreover, RCRM consists of some contributions: Traffic Predictions, Adaptive Cloud resource Allocation and Maximum Net Profit. RCRM analyzes the service blocking and the required number of VMs for each request by the M/M/m/m Markov chain model. Generally, since cloud providers oversell diverse types of cloud resources, the objective of maximizing net profit can be achieved. Furthermore, the cost of deploying data centers at different areas in the world is completely varied, because in different areas (or countries) the equipment deploying cost, the power cost, the building cost, and the engineering cost are definitely different. For achieving 5G network slicing in different domains, diverse-type of cloud resources among global data centers are adaptively allocated in this work. From performance evaluations, the proposed RCRM approach outperforms the others in dropping probability, SLA violation, violation penalty and net profit. Moreover, the dropping probability is analyzed and the probabilities of analysis and simulation are very close. This result can justify the correctness of the proposed Markov chain model.","2644-3163","978-1-7281-2530-5","10.1109/IEMCON.2019.8936273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936273","5G;Adaptive cloud resource;Markov chain analysis;VM migration;Task redirection;Cloud resource overselling","Cloud computing;Markov processes;Analytical models;Data centers;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Entertainment industry","cellular radio;cloud computing;computer centres;Markov processes;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;virtual machines","reward-based adaptive global cloud resource management;adaptive cloud resource allocation;global data centers;5G network slicing;equipment deploying cost;cloud providers;Markov chain model;Maximum Net Profit;RCRM;cloud manager;efficient cloud resource allocation;system reward;dynamic Service License Agreements;cloud reward;cloud cost;virtual cloud resources;5G Cloud era;maximizing cloud net profit;cloud access delay;global cloud data centers;diverse classes;5G cellular network;inter-Cloud virtual resources Allocation;Reward-based Markov chain analysis","","","","33","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The next-generation mobile networks heavily rely on virtualized infrastructure, and network slicing has emerged as a key enabler to support different virtualized services and applications in the 5G network. However, allocating network slices efficiently while providing a minimum guaranteed level of service, as well as providing defense against the threat of malicious co-residency in a mobile core network, is challenging. To address these questions, in our previous work, we proposed an optimization model to allocate slices. It provided a static and manual allocation of slices. In this work, we analyze the defense against the malicious co-residency using our optimization-based allocation, and we extend our work to dynamically allocate slices. We propose a dynamic slice allocation framework for the 5G core network. The proposed framework provides user-interaction to request slices and any required services that need to run on a slice(s). It can accept a single or multiple allocation requests, and it dynamically allocates them. Additionally, the framework allocates slices in a balanced fashion across available resources.

We propose a dynamic resource allocation problem with probabilistic isolation guarantee (DRAIG), which is formulated as a chance constrained program. As the true probability distribution of network loads is usually unknown, we use the Conditional Valuate-at-Risk (CVaR) measure to provide a distributionally robust formulation that approximate the basic chance constraints of DRA-IG in a data-driven manner.

Emerging 5G systems can already offer network slicing, multi-connectivity, and end-to-end quality provisioning mechanisms for critical data transfers within a single software-controlled network. Whereas these individual enablers are already in active development, a holistic perspective on how to construct a unified, service-ready system as well as understand the implications of critical traffic on serving other user sessions is not yet available. Against this background, this paper first introduces a softwarized 5G architecture for end-to-end reliability of the mission-critical traffic. Then, a mathematical framework is contributed to model the process of critical session transfers in a softwarized 5G access network, and the corresponding impact on other user sessions is quantified.

To maintain satisfactory user experience and high profit for service providers in a dynamic environment, a slice may need to be reconfigured according to the varying traffic demand and resource availability. However, frequent reconfigurations incur certain cost and might cause service interruption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid slice reconfiguration (HSR) framework, where a fast slice reconfiguration (FSR) scheme reconfigures flows for individual slices at the time scale of flow arrival/departure, while a dimensioning slices with reconfiguration (DSR) scheme is occasionally performed to adjust allocated resources according to the time-varying traffic demand. In order to optimize the slice's profit, i.e., the total utility minus the resource consumption and reconfiguration cost, we formulate the problems for FSR and DSR, which are difficult to solve due to the discontinuity and non-convexity of the reconfiguration cost function. Hence, we approximate the reconfiguration cost function with L<sub>1</sub> norm, which preserves the sparsity of the solution, thus facilitating restricting reconfigurations. Besides, we design an algorithm to schedule FSR and DSR, so that DSR is timely triggered according to the traffic dynamics and resource availability to improve the profit of slice. Furthermore, we extend HSR with a resource reservation mechanism, which reserves partial resources for near future traffic to reduce potential reconfigurations. Numerical results validate that our reconfiguration framework is effective in reducing reconfiguration overhead and achieving high profit for slices.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2899609","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631004,61871099); SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU/RES/01/2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642931","Network slicing;fast slice reconfiguration;slice dimensioning;L₁ norm optimization;SDN;NFV","Network slicing;Resource management;Pricing;Dynamic scheduling;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Cost function","reconfigurable architectures;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","DSR;reconfiguration cost function;FSR;traffic dynamics;resource availability;resource reservation mechanism;reconfiguration overhead;satisfactory user experience;service providers;frequent reconfigurations;service interruption;hybrid slice reconfiguration framework;dimensioning slices;allocated resources;time-varying traffic demand;resource consumption;network function virtualization;fast slice reconfiguration scheme;network slicing;flow arrival-departure;software-defined networks;dynamic environment","","23","","39","IEEE","15 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the design and implementation of a Hybrid SDN-based network application to provide dynamic services.

In such a scenario, effective end-to-end orchestration of the cognitive functions is vital to reap the full benefits of the available intelligence for automated operation. Existing work in orchestrating cognitive functions has limitations in scope and coverage, and addresses only certain aspects.

To maximize the slice's profit and reduce the reconfiguration overhead, we propose a fast slice reconfiguration (FSR) scheme to cope with small traffic variations of individual slices at the time scale of flow arrival/departure.

We propose to approximate the reconfiguration cost function with L1 norm, which preserves the sparsity of solution, thus avoiding unnecessary reconfigurations.

In this chapter, the relationship between the two is explored and the commonality between them is explained. In the simplest case, the resource can be set up as fixed blocks of spectrum allocated to a specific network operator (network sharing) or a particular set of services (network slicing). However, this can be inefficient in terms of use of resource and to overcome that inefficiency the concept of dynamic allocation is introduced, although that does introduce the possibility of inter‐cell interference between shares/slices. An extensive review of the literature in the area shows that such an approach will lead to significant benefits.Techniques to mitigate the interference are explained and it is shown that suitable control in the allocation of resources to users can lead to complete isolation between the slices, albeit at the expense of a small amount of the gain achieved through sharing. The effects of sharing spectrum or setting up slices in this way are demonstrated through example simulation results, although it is made clear that the example approach is used is just one way to achieve the mitigation required. In those example results the aim was to maximize the number of users who are allocated sufficient spectrum to achieve a capacity (in the Shannon sense) to meet their quality of service (QoS) requirements.","","9781119652458","10.1002/9781119652434.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9289940.pdf&bkn=9289922&pdfType=chapter","","Interference;Sensors;Radio spectrum management;Radio access networks;Resource management;Regulators;Optical fiber networks","","","","","","","","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

On the other side, dynamic sharing can greatly improve resource utilization, but it requires a strict control of performance parameters so as to guarantee small congestion probability and smoothed degradation when it occurs. In this paper, we propose a utility-based approach that can properly map the slice customization strategies that tenants can use to address the different traffic requirements and their specific service management policies.

However, there is still a lack of solutions for enterprise networks, without carrying a substantial increase in cost, adapted to their daily reality, in which the WAN can be split in several domains, each of them possibly managed by different operators and based on different technologies and protocols. As a result, today it is not possible to have a complete solution for SD-WAN that covers all domains, reducing its scope to a single set of domains which may interact with other external domains. To address this issue, this paper presents Alviu, a SD-WAN network orchestrator based on open-source technologies that assures end-to-end network slicing to managed enterprise and academic networks thanks to a dynamic intentbased configuration of the different elements of the managed network.

Cellular networks of the future necessitate the formulation of efficient resource allocation schemes that readily meet throughput requirements. The idea of combining Device-to-Device (D2D), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and Network slicing (NS) can improve spectrum utilization with better performance and scalability. This work presents a spectrum efficiency optimization problem in D2D based 5G-Heterogeneous Cellular Network (5G-HCN) with NS. Owing to the shortage of resources, we propose an underlay model where macro-cell users (MUs), small-cell users (SUs), and D2D users (DUs) reuse the resources while considering the effects of interference. The goal is to maximize the average network spectrum efficiency (SE) and throughput without degrading the system performance. The problem at hand is naturally a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that is intractable. Therefore, we have suggested a distributed resource allocation strategy with an edge computing (DRA-EC) approach to find the sub-optimal solution. In distributed augmented Lagrange method, each edge router located at BS will solve its problem locally, and the consensus algorithm will find the global solution using these local estimates. The central slice controller will cut the customized network slices according to the bandwidth requirements of each user type with optimized spectrum information. The simulation outcomes prove that our proposed method is near the central optimization scheme with low computational complexity. It is much better because it reduces the computational time and system overhead.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9543666","Network slicing;5G cellular networks;mobile edge computing;device-to-device;distributed optimization;consensus algorithm","Device-to-device communication;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Interference;Quality of service;Optimization;Edge computing","","","","","","65","CCBY","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wismüller","Institute of Computer Science, Universität Siegen, Siegen, Germany; Institute of Computer Science, Universität Siegen, Siegen, Germany","2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","7 Dec 2017","2017","","","1","6","With the increasingly amount of private information stored in mobile devices, the need for more secure ways to detect, control and avoid malicious behaviors has become higher. The too coarse-grained permission system implemented in the Android platform does not cover problems such as preventing an application to send a previously acquired information over SMS or Internet to another device or server. This problem arises because the permission systems implemented in the Android platform works only in the access control and does not handle how the acquired information is handled by the application. In order to enhance detection and awareness of such unwanted information flows, we propose a hybrid information-flow analysis, known as FlowSlicer, that mixes the benefits of static and dynamic analysis, using slicing on a system dependency graph and instrumenting statements found to be important. In order to analyse properly the obtained results, tests regarding overhead and also leak detection rate were performed in the applications present in the category AndroidSpecific from the DroidBench repository, since FlowSlicer intends to work mainly for applications designed for the Android platform. The results show that FlowSlicer is effective in detecting leaks, detects all leaks present in the evaluated applications, and only includes an imperceptible overhead to the instrumented application. The obtained results also show how both static and dynamic analysis work together and help each other in their disadvantages: static analysis helps dynamic analysis by reducing the set of statements to be analysed and dynamic analysis helps to prove false positives from static analysis not to be true.","2153-0742","978-1-5386-1585-0","10.1109/CCST.2017.8167856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8167856","","Androids;Humanoid robots;Smart phones;Instruments;Operating systems","Android (operating system);authorisation;data privacy;Internet;mobile computing;program diagnostics;program slicing","system dependency graph;instrumenting statements;leak detection rate;FlowSlicer;Android platform;dynamic analysis;static analysis;information leaks;Android applications;hybrid approach;program slicing;instrumentation;private information;mobile devices;malicious behaviors;coarse-grained permission system;permission systems;access control;unwanted information;hybrid information-flow analysis;information leak detection;tagging;Internet","","","","23","","7 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reflective calls can be analyzed statically or dynamically. Static analysis is more sound but also more imprecise (by introducing many false reflective targets and thus affecting its scalability). Dynamic analysis can be precise but often miss many true reflective targets due to low code coverage.We introduce MIRROR, the first automatic reflection analysis for Java that increases significantly the code coverage of dynamic analysis while keeping false reflective targets low. In its static analysis, a novel reflection-oriented slicing technique is applied to identify a small number of small path-based slices for a reflective call so that different reflective targets are likely exercised along these different paths. This preserves the soundness of pure static reflection analysis as much as possible, improves its scalability, and reduces substantially its false positive rate. In its dynamic analysis, these slices are executed with automatically generated test cases to report the reflective targets accessed. This significantly improves the code coverage of pure dynamic analysis. We evaluate MIRROR against a state-of-the-art dynamic reflection analysis tool, TAMIFLEX, by using 10 large real-world Java applications. MIRROR detects 12.5% - 933.3% more reflective targets efficiently (in 362.8 seconds on average) without producing any false positives.

To support the increasing communication data traffic and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS), spectrum slicing, spectrum allocating, and transmit power controlling are jointly considered. Accordingly, three non-convex network utility maximization problems are formulated to slice spectrum among base stations (BSs), allocate spectrum among autonomous vehicles (AVs) associated with a BS, and control transmit powers of BSs, respectively. Through linear programming relaxation and first-order Taylor series approximation, these problems are transformed into tractable forms and then are jointly solved through an alternate concave search (ACS) algorithm. As a result, the optimal spectrum slicing ratios among BSs, optimal BS-vehicle association patterns, optimal fractions of spectrum resources allocated to AVs, and optimal transmit powers of BSs are obtained. Based on our simulation, a high aggregate network utility is achieved by the proposed spectrum management scheme compared with two existing schemes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2922656","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:91638204); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8748212","Multi-access edge computing;NFV;spectrum resource allocation;QoS-guaranteed service;autonomous vehicles","Servers;Wireless fidelity;Radio spectrum management;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Quality of service;Edge computing","approximation theory;linear programming;multi-access systems;power control;quality of service;radio spectrum management;relaxation theory;resource allocation;search problems;series (mathematics);vehicular ad hoc networks","dynamic spectrum management framework;spectrum resource utilization;multiaccess edge computing;autonomous vehicular network;increasing communication data traffic;spectrum allocation;transmit power controlling;nonconvex network utility maximization problems;BS;allocate spectrum;autonomous vehicles;control transmit powers;linear programming relaxation;alternate concave search algorithm;optimal spectrum slicing ratios;optimal BS-vehicle association patterns;spectrum resources;optimal transmit powers;high aggregate network utility;spectrum management scheme","","21","","36","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rapid growth of multi-tenant applications with heterogeneous traffic require specialized quality of service (QoS) in terms of packet loss and latency to the DCN infrastructure. Slicing the DCNs into dedicated pieces according to the deployed applications, differentiated QoS, and high resource utilization can be provided. However, slicing the optical DCNs still needs to be investigated because the Software-defined Networking (SDN) technique is developed for the electrical networks, not fully supporting the properties of the optical network. Additionally, Network Slices (NS) need to be automatically provisioned and reconfigured, to provide flexible slice interconnections in support of the multi-tenant applications to be deployed. In this article, we propose and experimentally assess the automatic and flexible NSs configurations of optical OPSquare DCN controlled and orchestrated by an extended SDN control plane for multi-tenant applications with differentiated QoS provisioning. Optical Flow Control (OFC) protocol has been developed to prevent packet losses at switch sides caused by packet contentions. The extended OpenFlow (OF) protocol of SDN is deployed as well in support of the optical switching characteristics. Based on the collected resource topology of data plane, the optical network slices can be dynamically provisioned and automatically reconfigured by the SDN control plane. Meanwhile, experimental results validate that the priority assignment of application flows supplies dynamic QoS performance to various slices running applications with specific requirements in terms of packet loss and transmission latency. In addition, the capability of exposing traffic statistics information of data plane to SDN control plane enables the implementation of load balancing algorithms further improving the network performance with high QoS. No packet loss and less than 4.8 μs server-to-server latency can be guaranteed for the sliced network with highest priority at a load of 0.5.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.2965640","Olympics project(grant numbers:ESTAR17207); Metro-Haul Project(grant numbers:G.A. 761727); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955836","Data center network;Flow control;Optical interconnects;Optical switches;Software defined networking","Optical switches;Optical buffering;Quality of service;Packet loss;Optical packet switching","computer centres;optical switches;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","electrical networks;flexible slice interconnections;multitenant applications;flexible NSs configurations;optical OPSquare DCN;extended SDN control plane;differentiated QoS provisioning;Optical Flow Control protocol;packet loss;switch sides;optical switching characteristics;data plane;optical network slices;supplies dynamic QoS performance;network performance;high QoS;sliced network;optical switching techniques;optical data center network interconnections;electrical switch-based multitiered DCNs;DCN infrastructure;high resource utilization;optical DCNs;Software-defined Networking technique;quality of service;orchestrated OPSquare DCN;automatic Network slicing;time 4.8 mus","","6","","30","IEEE","10 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After that, the global network variation indicator is defined to characterize the topology evolution of the whole network under different slice sizes. Meanwhile, by determining the global network variation indicator interval (0.1, 0.3) and the value of 0.2, appropriate slice size can be determined. And the Encoder-LSTM-Decoder(E-LSTM-D) link prediction model is used to verify the slice effect. The experimental results show that, compared with some slice size commonly used on Infocom05, Infocom06 and Cambridge datasets, the one determined by NVISA improves the prediction effect 2.7%, 6.3% and 5.86% of the link prediction model.

In this paper, to meet the different rate requirements of VNs, we propose a novel slicing and scheduling scheme. In this scheme, each VN is assigned a certain number of sub-channels to provide services to its users. This number is changeable, which reflects the dynamic adjustability of our scheme. Scheduling isolation among VNs is realized in this scheme, which means that users in different VNs will not be scheduled together, and different scheduling schemes can be used for different VNs based on our scheme.

In this work, we propose a trace-based approach to identifying not only where the root cause of a regression bug lies, but also how the defect is propagated to its manifestation as the explanation. In our approach, we keep the trace of original correct version as reference and infer the faulty steps on the trace of regression version so that we can build a causality graph of how the defect is propagated. To this end, we overcomes two technical challenges. First, we align two traces derived from two versions of programs by extending state-of-the-art trace alignment technique for regression fault with novel relaxation technique. Second, we construct causality graph (i.e., explanation) by adopting a technique called alignment slicing and mending to isolate the failure-inducing changes and explain the failure. Our comparative experiment with the state-of-the-art techniques including dynamic slicing, delta-debugging, and symbolic execution on 24 real-world regressions shows that (1) our approach is more accurate on isolating the failure-inducing changes, (2) the generated explanation requires acceptable manual effort to inspect, and (3) our approach requires lower runtime overhead. In addition, we also conduct an applicability experiment based on Defects4J bug repository, showing the potential limitations of our trace-based approach and providing guidance for its practical use.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2949568","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632015, 61721002, U1766215, 61833015); the National Cybersecurity R D Directorate; the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 Grant; National Key R D Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1000903); Singapore Telecommunications Limited; the National Research Foundation Prime Ministers Office Singapore under its Corporate Laboratory University Scheme National University of Singapore and under its National Cybersecurity RD Program(grant numbers:NRF2014NCR-NCR001-30); the National Satellite of Excellence in Trustworthy Software Systems funded by NRF Singapore under National Cyber-security R D programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883062","Regression bug;trace alignment;alignment slicing and mending;fault localization","Computer bugs;Semantics;Debugging;Java;Software;Runtime;Task analysis","","","","2","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The basic approach of prior accelerators is to focus on a single graph algorithm variant (eg. bulk-synchronous + slicing). While helpful for specialization, this leaves performance potential from flexibility on the table and also complicates understanding the relationship between graph types, workloads, algorithms, and specialization.In this work, we explore the value of flexibility in graph processing accelerators. First, we identify a taxonomy of key algorithm variants. Then we develop a template architecture (PolyGraph) that is flexible across these variants while being able to modularly integrate specialization features for each.Overall we find that flexibility in graph acceleration is critical. If only one variant can be supported, asynchronous-updates/priority-vertex-scheduling/graph-slicing is the best design, achieving 1.93× speedup over the best-performing accelerator, GraphPulse. However, static flexibility per-workload can further improve performance by 2.71×.

It decomposes a single Radio Access Network (RAN) into multiple virtual networks ""slices"" to meet demands in term of throughput, mobility, latency, reliability, etc. Slicing needs real-time reconfigurations to keep current with demands' dynamics. This results in an increased cost of Operation Expenditures (OPEX). We approached this challenge as an optimization problem of infrastructure's resources. We virtualized and pooled Baseband Units (BBUs) resources on cloud. Dynamic allocation and interconnection with Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are made possible by leveraging the advents of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined Networking (SDN). We implemented Distributed Base Station (DBS) using open software platform along to a public service orchestration tool for clouds. Our contribution is integrating service selection and deployment with real-time monitoring that allowed auto-control of resources by looping resources' lifecycle. In our experiments, we deployed several slices and we tested two scenarios. First scenario addressed slices' auto-scaling (Infrastructure Scale- Out/Scale-In) when free resources are available in the pool. Second scenario simulated slices' breathing (orchestration of resources) when the pool of resources is exhausted. In first scenario, results show that leveraging cloud elasticity by auto-scaling resources saves costs by providing exactly ""what-is-needed"" ""when-it-is- needed"" in term of cloud computing. In second scenario, results show that slices' breathing maximizes the usability by employing our ""inhale-and-exhale"" heuristic. It is about reusing resources from under-loaded slices in favor of overloaded ones with seamless effect on the user-experience.","","978-1-5386-1254-5","10.1109/MENACOMM.2018.8371035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8371035","5G;NFV;SDN;Network Slicing;Resources Auto- Scaling;Orchestration.","Cloud computing;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Reliability;Monitoring;Resource management;Containers","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;optimisation;radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;virtualisation","multiple virtual networks;real-time reconfigurations;optimization problem;open software platform;public service orchestration tool;integrating service selection;leveraging cloud elasticity;auto-scaling resources;under-loaded slices;5G RAN;remote radio heads;network slicing implementation optmisation;single radio access network;baseband units resources;network function virtualization;NFV;software defined networking;SDN","","5","","17","","4 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, network resources, roadside unit devices and sunken edge nodes need to work together to guarantee real-time network communication. Thus, they can jointly help improve the quality of network services and user experience, and show the level of vehicle-road collaboration wisdom in terms of safety, efficiency and service.

There are ways to create 3D faces that are done manually using complex software but this also requires special skills, there are also other ways that use sophisticated methods such as artificial intelligent. However, both require a long time and process. In this study a simple method is applied, in the form of 2D face point mapping to 3D face point by utilizing linear equations that are built based on the Gauss elimination method. As a first step, two 2D face models and two 3D face models are correlated. Both are used as template for finding the basic formula, then the area of the two faces is normalized from 2D and 3D models into x and y coordinates so that they have the same area. Thus, each point of a 2D face model will have a correlation with the point of the 3D face model. Each x and y coordinate of the two models is at the same point, plus z-point information obtained from the 3D face model. Next, by slicing the 3D face model in the direction of the y-axis, you get a number of slices image of x and z axes. From each slice, several points are taken with coordination of x and z as a reference to determine the linear equation. With the Gauss elimination method, a linear equation can be built. After obtaining two models of linear equations for each slice derived from two different 3D models, a linear equation can be determined for the slices of the query model. The value obtained by a point in the query model, involving a comparison of colors between two adjacent points, is an interpolation of the two equations obtained. With the linear equation in each slice plane, a triangular face attribute can be built in a neater 3D model. In addition, you can also specify the number of vertices and faces. This is useful for modifying the 3D model. This research results in how to make 3D face models based on 2D face models more quickly, without training data. The results of this study can encourage the discovery of more template models that will increase the accuracy of the results obtained.","","978-1-7281-4449-8","10.1109/ELECSYM.2019.8901537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901537","3D face;slice image;linear equation;gauss elimination;vertices;faces","","face recognition","linear equation;3D face making;3D face point mapping model;2D face point mapping model;computer vision;Gauss elimination method;artificial intelligent;z-point information;query model;interpolation","","","","8","","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many emerging services such as smart city, Industry 4.0, and autonomous driving are based on IoT devices and applications to collect and analyze data and control end devices (i.e., actuators). Among these services, several IoT applications, such as data analytics, need to be deployed at the edge to either reduce the latency to access data or treat the high amount of generated data locally. However, in the context of LoRa/LoRaWAN, most of the current IoT service deployments run the applications at a central cloud to ease the integration with existing software as a service (SaaS) platforms, without exploiting the benefits of edge computing. In this article, we propose a new framework that leverages the ETSI multi-access edge computing (MEC) model to deploy LoRabased IoT applications at the edge. In particular, the proposed model takes advantage of the ETSI MEC features, such as dynamic deployment of an IoT application at the edge and application life cycle management. In addition, the proposed framework allows running an IoT application as a 5G network slice at the edge.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.1900051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139047","","Internet of Things;Logic gates;Servers;Edge computing;Network servers;Computer architecture;Cloud computing","cloud computing;Internet of Things;wide area networks","low-power wide area network technologies;narrowband IoT;emerging services;control end devices;data analytics;access data;IoT service deployments;ETSI multiaccess edge computing model;LoRabased IoT applications;ETSI MEC features;dynamic deployment;application life cycle management;LoRaWAN","","1","","13","","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Existing market-level defenses are still ineffective, as static analysis is fundamentally unable to reason about the intention of an app and dynamic analysis has low coverage. We introduce TDroid, a new market-level approach to detecting app switching attacks. The challenge lies in how to handle a plethora of input-dependent branch predicates (forming an exponential number of paths) that control the execution of the code responsible for launching such attacks. TDroid tackles this challenge by combining static and dynamic analysis to analyze an app without producing any false positives. In its static analysis, TDroid transforms the app into runnable slices containing potentially app switching attacks, one slice per attack. In its dynamic analysis, TDroid executes these slices on an Android phone or emulator to expose their malicious GUIs. The novelty lies in the use of a new trigger-oriented slicing technique in producing runnable slices so that certain input-dependent branch predicates are specialized to execute always some fixed branches. Evaluated with a large set of malware apps, TDroid is shown to outperform the state of the art, by detecting substantially more app switching attacks, in a few minutes per app, on average.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-5937-5","10.1145/3238147.3238188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000042","Android GUI Security;Static Analysis;Dynamic Analysis","","Android (operating system);computer crime;invasive software;program diagnostics;program slicing","malicious app;denial-of-service attacks;static analysis;dynamic analysis;malware apps;TDroid;app switching attacks;Android;market-level defenses","","2","","61","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize deltas in dynamic invariants generated from successive test executions to learn significance of changes with respect to the target functionality.

The decomposition brings unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing dynamics of different semantic units such as groups and objects, (2) it learns separated appearance and dynamic representations while keeping proper interactions between them, and (3) it exploits the selectiveness of spatial filters to discard irrelevant background clutter for crowd understanding.

Not only the visual perception but also the algorithmic efficiency at outdoor environment vastly impacted due to adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, snow, etc. These weather conditions largely degrade video quality by inducing complex noise into video frames especially due to mutual motion between capture assembly/ camera and object/ scene of interest. This greatly hampers video analytics and computer vision in various real time applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart surveillance etc. Hence, restoring clean video from adverse effect of environment is one of the most important challenge in video analytics. With the aim of tackling this problem this paper proposes an efficient method of deraining videos by applying bilateral filtering on time-sliced video frames. The proposed idea exploited the strength of range-domain filtering possessed by bilateral filters and the spatio-temporal model of time-slicing.

In this paper, we propose a bandwidth resource's dynamic allocation scheme which is suitable for both Enhance Mobile Broadband (eMBB) scenario and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) scenario. Based on the classical Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture, admission control is introduced to maintain the resource utilization of the network, and the delay penalty factor we set can guarantee the low delay of the network. Besides, we make a tradeoff between the benefit and the cost of network when adjusting resources. Simulation results show that the algorithm can meet the performance requirements of different application scenarios while minimizing the cost of dynamic resource adjustment.","1948-9447","978-1-7281-5855-6","10.1109/CCDC49329.2020.9164338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9164338","Internet of Things (IoT);Multiple scenarios;5G;Network slices;Dynamic resource allocation","Resource management;Delays;Bandwidth;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;5G mobile communication;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;broadband networks;Internet of Things;optimisation;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication network reliability","dynamic resource optimization allocation;5G network slice;IoT applications;enhance mobile broadband scenario;classical software defined network architecture;resource utilization;delay penalty factor;low delay;dynamic resource adjustment;ultra reliable and low latency communication scenario;Internet of Things;bandwidth resource dynamic allocation scheme;admission control;cost minimization","","","","20","","11 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However these novel Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) necessitate increasingly complex monitoring and control schemes, which are commonly orchestrated by industrial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. As thousands of distributed field devices are involved in the operation of Critical Infrastructures, the enabling communication technologies need to fulfil exacting performance requirements as well as provide high levels of robustness, Quality of Service, flexibility and scalability. The ongoing evolution of cellular LTE (Long Term Evolution) towards 5G networks promises to meet all these specifications. In this context Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is set to play a crucial part within the mobile network's wired backhaul as well as core infrastructures and is thus included in many proposed 5G architectures. However, basic performance characteristics allowing a comparison of the two prevalent approaches to SDN, fully virtualised and hardware based Bare-Metal switching, are currently not widely available. Therefore this paper proposes a test-platform for the benchmarking of SDN as well as a prototypical architecture. The latter serves to facilitate the evolutionary development of LTE towards 5G for use in Critical Infrastructure communication in general and Smart Grids in particular. A comparative evaluation of switching performance, realized via the described testbed, is presented and an assessment is given. Based on the introduced architecture and testbed, future work will develop new mechanisms for end-to-end slicing as well as application aware scheduling.","","978-1-4673-9486-4","10.1109/NETSOFT.2016.7502484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502484","","Switches;5G mobile communication;Smart grids;Long Term Evolution;Performance evaluation;Computer architecture;Protocols","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;Long Term Evolution;software defined networking;telecommunication switching","virtualized switching;bare-metal switching;SDN-based 5G communication;critical infrastructure communication;smart grids;automated transportation systems;industrial supervisory control-and-data acquisition systems;industrial SCADA systems;distributed field devices;performance requirements;quality-of-service;cellular LTE;cellular Long Term Evolution;5G networks;software-defined networking;mobile network wired backhaul;core infrastructures;5G architectures;end-to-end slicing;application aware scheduling","","8","","19","","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to satisfy the required QoS of serving users, each network slice deploys appropriate VNFs on different Base Stations (BSs) and orchestrates them for providing uniform service like an independent virtual network. However, due to the user mobility, the VNF on the BS may not have sufficient resource to provide QoS guaranteed services for newly accessed users. It is challenging to allocate adequate resource dynamically for VNFs to guarantee the required QoS of roaming users. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource allocation scheme for VNF based on group mobility prediction. We first employ Markov chain and online learning method together to predict group mobility of users. Then we calculate the popularities of BSs for allocating more resource to the hotspot BSs (HBSs) with aim of enabling HBS permit the enormous service requests of approaching users. We propose a complementarity mechanism to maximize resource efficiency when implementing resource allocation for VNFs. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic resource allocation scheme.","","978-1-7281-1439-2","10.1109/ICCET.2019.8726889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726889","network function virtualization;virtual network function;group mobility prediction;base station popularity;dynamic resource allocation","Resource management;Handover;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Markov processes;Network slicing","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;quality of service;radiocommunication;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;virtualisation","VNF;dynamic resource allocation scheme;Network Function Virtualization;virtual network functions;network slice;BSs;uniform service;independent virtual network;user mobility;QoS guaranteed services;roaming users;group mobility prediction;resource efficiency;wireless communication system;VNFs;standardized network equipment;Base station popularity;online learning method;Markov chain","","","","14","","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently many Multi-cloud storage services have been proposed but most of them focus on the single specific organization and file formats. In addition most providers use attribute based encryption which encrypts only particular database fields which reduces the trust of the many individuals and organizations. The biggest challenge that the present business world faces in multi-cloud storage is that there is no single standard architecture and procedure that can meet the requirements of the individuals and organizations. In order to address this challenge, this paper presents an effective architectural framework with a standard algorithm which would enable to enhance the secure data sharing through dynamic index based cryptographic data slicing.

The roughness affects the mechanical stability (due to surface defects) as well as the effective minority carrier lifetime (surface recombination velocity). In this paper, we have developed a dynamic finite element analysis to correlate the surface roughness of a spalled silicon wafer with the stress applied at the crack tip. These predictions were experimentally validated with crack velocity measurements and surface roughness analysis for different applied stresses.

However, their analog nature of computing poses significant issues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear I-V characteristics of the memristor device etc. The non-idealities can have a detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy. To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. First, we perform extensive HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance combinations. Based on the obtained data, we train a neural network to learn the transfer characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional simulator which includes key architectural facets such as tiling, and bit-slicing to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx achieves low root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.25 and 0.7 for low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the GENIEx errors are 7× and 12.8× better than an analytical model which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate the degradation in classification accuracy by ≥ 10% on CIFAR-100 and 3.7% on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.","0738-100X","978-1-7281-1085-1","10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218688","","","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix multiplication;mean square error methods;memristors;neural nets;vectors","GENIEx;nonideal crossbar;linear nonidealities;memristive crossbars;memristive Xbars;neural networks;nondata-dependent models;HSPICE simulations;generalized approach to emulating non-ideality in memristive crossbars;root mean square errors;RMSE;matrix vector multiplication;MVM","","10","","27","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present a novel deep learning architecture, known as Temporal Tensor Transformation Network, which transforms the original multivariate time series into a higher order of tensor through the proposed Temporal-Slicing Stack Transformation. This yields a new representation of the original multivariate time series, which enables the convolution kernel to extract complex and non-linear features as well as variable interactional signals from a relatively large temporal region.

Our technique, called MOAD (Modeling Observation-based Approximate Dependency), reformulates program dependency as the likelihood that one program element is dependent on another, instead of a more classical Boolean relationship. MOAD generates a set of program variants by deleting parts of the source code, and executes them while observing the impacts of the deletions on various program points. From these observations, MOAD infers a model of program dependency that captures the dependency relationship between the modification and observation points. While MOAD is a purely dynamic dependency analysis technique similar to Observation Based Slicing (ORBS), it does not require iterative deletions. Rather, MOAD makes a much smaller number of multiple, independent observations in parallel and infers dependency relationships for multiple program elements simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of dynamic dependency analysis. We evaluate MOAD by instantiating program slices from the obtained probabilistic dependency model. Compared to ORBS, MOAD's model construction requires only 18.7% of the observations used by ORBS, while its slices are only 16% larger than the corresponding ORBS slice, on average.","2470-6892","978-1-7281-4937-0","10.1109/SCAM.2019.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930847","Dependency analysis;Program slicing;Model learning","Analytical models;Probabilistic logic;Inference algorithms;Semantics;Performance analysis;Tools;Trajectory","iterative methods;probability;program diagnostics;program slicing;statistical analysis","program analysis;approximate program dependency;program element;program variants;program points;dependency relationship;independent observations;multiple program elements;program slices;probabilistic dependency model;modeling observation-based approximate dependency;dynamic dependency analysis technique;MOAD model construction","","1","","30","","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These networks are expected to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives. Social and cognitive mobile computing requires the sharing of data recorded by sensor nodes. However, the data can be vulnerable to attacks. It is of utmost importance to protect the users privacy while ensuring the security of the WSNs. This investigation is focused on the source-location privacy (SLP) of WSNs. This article proposes a dynamic multipath privacy-preserving routing (DMPPR) scheme based on multiple sinks for protecting the privacy. Different from single sink schemes, the technique of using multiple sink nodes to protect SLP is discussed in this article. Furthermore, a packet-slicing transmission scheme that generates a large number of dynamic routings based on multiple sink nodes is adopted for transmitting the packets. Local adversaries are considered, and to cope with these adversaries, a transmission loop, constructed using real and fake packets, is proposed to confuse the adversaries during the source detection process. The aim is to break the sociality between the sensor nodes. Simulations performed in MATLAB show that the proposed method outperforms similar existing schemes in terms of the secure time, adversary's capture probability, and node utilization ratio. Moreover, the DMPPR scheme also reduces energy consumption by allowing more nodes in the nonhotspot areas to participate in the packet transmission process.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2953937","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFE0125300); National Natural Science Foundation of China-Guangdong Joint Fund(grant numbers:U1801264); Jiangsu Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:BE2019648); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971206,61773254,91648119,U1813217); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:17DZ1205000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903472","Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);multipath routing;multiple sink nodes;source-location protection;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Privacy;Security;Mobile computing;Monitoring","computer network security;data protection;Internet of Things;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","dynamic multipath scheme;source-location privacy protection;multiple sinks;WSN security;cognitive mobile computing;wireless sensor networks;sensor nodes;SLP;dynamic multipath privacy-preserving routing scheme;single sink schemes;multiple sink nodes;packet-slicing transmission scheme;dynamic routings;source detection process;node utilization ratio;DMPPR scheme;packet transmission process;IIoT;social mobile computing;transmission loop;local adversaries;Matlab;adversary capture probability;industrial Internet of Things","","21","","27","IEEE","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several key properties are established, including: the Pareto-optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of base stations' resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm, which meets performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a practical approach with limited computational information and handoff overheads.

Our framework is language independent, because it is built on top of Truffle, an open-source platform, developed in Oracle Labs, for implementing dynamic languages in the form of AST interpreters. Our framework supports the creation of a diverse variety of program comprehension techniques, such as query, program slicing, and back-in-time debugging, because it is centered around a powerful information-flow tracking engine. Tools developed with our framework get access to the information-flow through a program execution. While it is possible to develop similarly powerful tools without our framework, for example by tracking information-flow through bytecode instrumentation, our approach leads to information that is closer to source code constructs, thus more comprehensible by the user. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we applied it to two of Truffle-based languages namely Simple Language and TruffleRuby, and we distill our experience into guidelines for developers of other Truffle-based languages who want to develop program comprehension tools for their language.","","978-1-5386-0535-6","10.1109/ICPC.2017.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961535","Information flow;AST interpreter;Language-independent;Program comprehension;Tool;Dependency","Tools;Java;Runtime;Instruments;Program processors;Debugging;Libraries","program diagnostics;programming languages","language-independent information flow tracking engine;program comprehension tool;programming language;language-independent framework;deep dynamic analysis;Truffle open-source platform;Oracle Labs;AST interpreters;program execution;bytecode instrumentation;simple language;TruffleRuby","","","","25","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel online convex optimization (OCO) framework for the IS-RRM, where the instant resource allocation is learned by using historical data revealed from previous allocations. Compared with the existing methods, OCO is an online optimization process that can avoid sophisticated modeling and tuning in highly complicated and dynamic environments. Specifically, a low-complexity online ISRRM algorithm is proposed, which employs multiple expert-algorithms running parallelly to keep track of environmental changes.

Among other techniques, virtual network function (VNF) mapping and scheduling are crucial to the deployment of SDN/NFV-enabled network services. In this paper, to enhance the performance of service provisioning, dynamic VNF mapping and scheduling are jointly investigated. Specifically, to achieve load balancing with QoS guarantee, we first formulate the VNF mapping and scheduling problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). We then propose a two-stage online algorithm to address the NP-hardness of the MILP. In particular, when new service arrives, we map and schedule the VNFs on a service function chain (SFC) by greedily minimizing the waiting time of VNFs. If the delay requirement cannot be satisfied after the first stage, a delay-aware rescheduling scheme is triggered, in which selected existing VNFs are remapped and rescheduled. The proposed dynamic approach achieves flexible function placement and increases service acceptance ratio. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013429","","Dynamic scheduling;Substrates;Heuristic algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Quality of service;Delays","communication complexity;integer programming;linear programming;quality of service;software defined networking;telecommunication scheduling;virtualisation","service acceptance ratio;service function chain;network function virtualization;heterogeneous network resources;service customization;virtual network function mapping;service provisioning;dynamic VNF mapping;flexible function placement;SFC;delay-aware rescheduling scheme;NFV;MILP;mixed integer linear programming;QoS;NP-hardness","","3","","18","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, even though most of the available video saliency data sets and models claim to target human observers' fixations, they fail to differentiate them from smooth pursuits (SPs), a major eye movement type that is unique to perception of dynamic scenes. In this work, we strive for a more meaningful prediction and conceptual understanding of saliency in general. Because of the higher attentional selectivity of smooth pursuit compared to fixations modelled in traditional saliency research, we refer to the problem of SP prediction as “supersaliency”. To make this distinction explicit, we (i) use algorithmic and manual annotations of SPs and fixations for two well-established video saliency data sets, (ii) train Slicing Convolutional Neural Networks for saliency prediction on either fixation- or SP-salient locations, and (iii) evaluate our and 26 publicly available dynamic saliency models on three data sets against traditional saliency and supersaliency ground truth. Overall, our models outperform the state of the art in both the new supersaliency and the traditional saliency problem settings, for which literature models are optimised. Importantly, on two independent data sets, our supersaliency model shows greater generalisation ability than its counterpart saliency model and outperforms all other models, even for fixation prediction. Furthermore, we tested an end-to-end video saliency model, which also showed systematic improvements when smooth pursuit was predicted either exclusively or together with fixations, with the best performance achieved when the model was trained for the supersaliency problem. This demonstrates the practical benefits and the potential of principled training data selection based on eye movement analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961835","Elitenetzwerk Bayern; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939422","Eye movements;saliency;smooth pursuit prediction","Data models;Predictive models;Pipelines;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Brain;Prediction algorithms","computer vision;eye;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;video signal processing;visual perception","smooth pursuit-based attention;human computer vision;video saliency data sets;SPs;eye movement type;dynamic scenes;attentional selectivity;SP prediction;saliency prediction;supersaliency model;generalisation ability;counterpart saliency model;fixation prediction;end-to-end video saliency model;principled training data selection;eye movement analysis","","","","97","CCBY","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The era of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), and networked technologies have revolutionized the paradigm of healthcare. In the healthcare domain, digital images are a means by which sensitive information about the patients can be transferred wirelessly. Maintaining the confidentiality of these images requires designing a cryptosystem that is fast and sturdy. In this work, we present a fast chaos-based encryption scheme for medical images. The scheme employs a Logistic map, Chebyshev map, and Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM) for confusion and diffusion of the medical image. Initially, the image is circularly shifted, and subsequently, bit plane slicing is performed. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) plane is replaced with a plane formed by the XOR operation between the MSB and 7<sup>th</sup> ISB plane. The resultant image is scrambled using the Pseudo Random Number (PRN) generated by the Logistic map. The scheme is adaptive and calculates the image parameter like sum or mean to determine the initial condition for the PWLCM chaotic map. The PWLCM is used to generate a key image that is XORed with the scrambled image. Finally, a Chebyshev map is iterated and a PRN sequence is generated to permute the image pixels and obtain the final encrypted image. The cryptosystem has been evaluated for multiple types and sizes of medical images and on natural images as well. The average encryption time for an image of size 256×256 is 0.3287 seconds. The entropy is more than 99.70% and the correlation coefficient is close to zero for all the images. Simulation results validate that the cryptosystem has comparable performance with state-of-the-art schemes.","","978-1-6654-1450-0","10.1109/ICIEM51511.2021.9445362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445362","Image encryption;Chaotic systems;Medical Image security","Correlation coefficient;Chaotic communication;Medical services;Chebyshev approximation;Entropy;Encryption;Information and communication technology","chaos;cryptography;health care;iterative methods;medical image processing;random number generation","medical image;healthcare;digital images;fast chaos-based encryption scheme;logistic map;Chebyshev map;piecewise linear chaotic map;image parameter;PWLCM chaotic map;key image;scrambled image;image pixels;final encrypted image;natural images;fast image encryption framework;bit plane slicing;most significant bit plane","","","","17","","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong per-slice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled “switch node”, called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices.

We consider how a 5G wireless provider may set per-class differential prices to maximize its profit when offering different network slices to different classes of customers. We formulate the problem using fundamental economic principles and present a Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm to solve the problem in a dynamic setting.

It provides seamless services such as e-commerce, e-health, e-banking, etc., to the end users. These services are hosted on massive geodistributed data centers (DCs), which may be managed by different service providers. For faster response time, such a data explosion creates the need to expand DCs. So, to ease the load on DCs, some of the applications may be executed on the edge devices near to the proximity of the end users. However, such a multi-edge-cloud environment involves huge data migrations across the underlying network infrastructure, which may generate long migration delay and cost. Hence, in this paper, an efficient workload slicing scheme is proposed for handling data-intensive applications in multiedge-cloud environment using software-defined networks (SDN). To handle the inter-DC migrations efficiently, an SDN-based control scheme is presented, which provides energy-aware network traffic flow scheduling. Finally, a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is proposed to provide cost-effective inter-DC migrations.

To meet these criteria, 5G aims to provide network slices, i.e., virtually independent architectures on top of a single, unified communication infrastructure. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been identified as key technologies for implementing such a solution. This work utilizes these ingredients in conjunction for providing isolated end-to-end slices, from wireline cloud servers over the Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based Long Term Evolution (LTE) Radio Access Network (RAN) down to individual User Equipments (UEs). Thereby, a prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution is designed and implemented. The system enables independent management of each slice by either its respective owner or the ICT infrastructure operator. Also, resources are allocated dynamically to slice tenants in order of their priority. A comprehensive empirical evaluation based on real-world traffic patterns, such as Floating Car Data (FCD), is given.

This approach has not considered the scenarios where different slices require different PHY and MAC layers, for instance, for radically different services and for whole-stack research in wireless living labs where novel PHY and MAC layers need to be deployed concurrently with existing ones on the same physical infrastructure. To enable whole-stack slicing where different PHY and MAC layers may be deployed in different slices, we develop PV-RAN, the first open-source virtual RAN platform that enables the sharing of the same SDR physical resources across multiple slices. Through API Remoting, PV-RAN enables running paravirtualized instances of OpenAirInterface (OAI) at different slices without requiring modifying OAI source code. PV-RAN effectively leverages the inter-domain communication mechanisms of Xen to transport time-sensitive I/Q samples via shared memory, making the virtualization overhead in communication almost negligible.

Remote sensing from UAS platforms is now common and the use of light and smart multi/hyper-spectral cameras has opened the field to novel applications. These sensors can operate in cloudy conditions ensuring ultra high resolution images while at the same time overcoming the limitations of satellite photography. In this paper we focus on just one such advanced payload application, namely, the segmentation of treecover / canopies over soil terrain. This task is mandatory in order to mask-out areas that are not of direct interest. The approaches studied are based on both supervised and unsupervised algorithms which take into account multi-spectral as well as synthetic features derived from the Digital Surface Model (DSM). We process the DSM by testing 2D convolution kernels together with a pseudo-random image slicing that tries to derive/model the ground/soil profile. Global thresholding is not able the segment tree / canopy area over the soil because the terrain slope is subject to significant change over small areas as is often seen to be the case with vineyards. The proposed approach takes into account such local variability to ensure a correct segmentation analysis in presence of slopes or other undulatory terrain variations. The results obtained show that the proposed method enables the segmentation of tree / canopy vs soil with an overall accuracy greater than 95%.","","978-1-5090-4495-5","10.1109/ICUAS.2017.7991526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991526","Segmentation;multi-spectral camera;soil;crop;UAV application","Soil;Agriculture;Vegetation;Image segmentation;Kernel;Convolution;Correlation","crops;remote sensing;soil","soil-crop segmentation;remotely sensed data;unmanned aerial system;UAS;advanced payload;remote sensing apparatus;smart multihyper-spectral cameras;ultra high resolution images;satellite photography;advanced payload application;treecover;mask-out areas;supervised-unsupervised algorithms;ground-soil profile;global thresholding;segmentation analysis;undulatory terrain variations","","3","","24","","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, with one-time platform-independent code development, the application can be executed on multiple devices, such as a group of end devices, a smart gateway and the cloud system.

Wireless network virtualization through slicing of primary wireless resources is regarded as an emerging approach for enhancing overall network performance to solve the bottleneck problem for those emerging applications. In this paper, we study wireless virtualization where a three-layer game is formulated for wireless infrastructure providers (WIPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), and IoT devices (or end users). In the proposed three-layer game, players play sequentially to find out their optimal strategies. With the help of a controller, WIPs divide and reconfigure their RF bands to sublease frequency slices to MVNOs based on their service-level-agreement. MVNOs let end users use their subleased frequency slices. For the game, we present a unique optimal solution that facilitates a tradeoff between quality of service of end users, payoffs of MVNOs and payoff of WIPs. We also present a necessary condition and closed form for the existence of an equilibrium in the game. Furthermore, performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results which show that the payoffs of WIPs and MVNOs are maximized while offering competitive price for the subleased RF spectrum for their users.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2874884","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1658972,CNS-1650831); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486622","Internet of Things (IoT);mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs);wireless infrastructure providers (WIPs);wireless virtualization","Wireless communication;Games;Virtualization;Internet of Things;Radio frequency;Quality of service;Base stations","cloud computing;game theory;Internet of Things;mobile computing;quality of service;virtualisation","three-layer game;wireless infrastructure providers;WIPs;mobile virtual network operators;MVNOs;IoT devices;end users;subleased frequency slices;payoff optimization;wireless network virtualization;IoT applications;three layer game approach;lightweight hand-held;primary wireless resources;network performance;service-level-agreement;quality of service;closed form;static assignment","","17","","22","","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many decades of race for performance has increased the total power consumption of supercomputers. Very few studies provide deep insights into the power and energy consumption of scientific applications. A detailed performance, power and energy analysis is essential to identify the most compute intensive and costly parts of an application and to develop possible improvement strategies. In this paper, we focus on power and performance modeling of various HPC benchmarks and scientific applications in order to reduce energy consumption. We study the power-performance efficiency and conserve energy using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) for scientific applications such as High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME), STREAM and Seasonal Forecasting Model (SFM). The HPC applications are executed in certain voltage and frequency (v/f) for CPU. The v/f used for execution of a job has a key impact on overall energy consumption. We evaluated HPC scientific applications by changing v/f during run-time for CPU and observed an average measured energy savings of 11.6% and a maximum of 14.8% with less than 5% performance degradation. The approach is to reduce energy at run-time by slowing down (applying voltage and frequency scaling) the processor during light workloads. The processor will deliver high performance whenever required, while significantly reducing power consumption during low workload periods. Our idea is to profiling and characterizing the application into multiple sections using time slicing to efficiently determine optimal frequency and voltage combinations over all the sections in the application using knowledge base. Selecting an optimal frequency and voltage by profile based technique requires several runs of the application with varying input data sizes. Another methodology is to combine power measurements and performance modeling to predict energy consumption for various frequency and voltage combinations. The findings and analysis of these high performance scientific applications can be used by energy aware schedulers to reduce energy consumption with very less or no performance degradation.","","978-1-5386-2389-3","10.1109/ADCOM.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8385597","Power and Performance Modelling;High Performance Computing;Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling;Energy Optimization","Energy consumption;Power demand;Optimization;Knowledge based systems;Power measurement;Benchmark testing;Frequency measurement","benchmark testing;energy conservation;natural sciences computing;parallel processing;power aware computing;power consumption","profile based technique;time slicing;CPU;SFM;STREAM and Seasonal Forecasting Model;MEME;Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation;NPB;NAS Parallel Benchmarks;HPL benchmark;DVFS;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;power consumption;high performance computing systems;average measured energy savings;HPC scientific applications;High Performance Linpack benchmark;frequency scaling;power-performance efficiency;energy analysis;energy optimization;energy aware schedulers;high performance scientific applications;energy consumption;power measurements","","","","31","","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is necessary in the scenario where a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) owns the Radio Access Network (RAN) and many Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) act as resellers of their host network's capacity under their own brands, to their own customers. In such scenarios, the forecasted MVNO traffic is the basis for providing resources suitable with the corresponding MVNOs demand. To that end, the dynamic provision of resources among MVNOs should be performed in flexible, short-term time scales. In this paper, we effectively address this issue by integrating the capacity broker into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network management architecture using the minimum set of enhancements. In addition, to fully exploit its capabilities, we propose the Multi-tenant Slicing (MuSli) of capacity algorithm, to allocate resources towards MVNOs in coarse time scales. MuSli considers the estimated capacity and the impact of the traffic type (i.e., guaranteed QoS and Best-Effort) in each MVNO, to provide better utilization of the host network's capacity.

The novel designs of the proposed mechanism mainly include the highest priority-controlled DRX (HPC-DRX) and traffic regulation plus time slicing (TRTS) schemes. In our proposed HPC-DRX/TRTS, lower priority traffic never wakes user equipments (UEs) up and all incoming traffic for UEs is temporarily buffered at the evolved Node B (eNB) and then transmitted in bursts using the overall bandwidth, yielding much better power saving performance. To support multiple users with multi-services, this paper proposes the resource allocation and burst scheduling algorithms for the HPC-DRX/TRTS. The power saving ratios of the proposed mechanisms were theoretically analyzed based on an M/G/1 busy period model. Both the percentage of sleep period and actual power consumption model were used in calculating the power saving ratio. Numerical results show that our analytical results are accurate and the proposed HPC-DRX/TRTS significantly outperforms the conventional DRX, dynamic and adjustable DRX (DADRX), and coalesced DRX in terms of power saving ratio.

The main point is that such manipulations can lead to information loss due to the histogram truncation in cases when pixel values are out of the dynamic range. In order to address the issue a novel technique is suggested. Cumulative histogram slices as a pivot for the subsequent image features calculations are used. The points of slicing are calculated in a way they are robust to content preserving manipulations such as brightness and contrast corrections. This approach allows one to handle situations when some of the content slices are lost due to the pixel value overflow. On the other hand, if one tampers image content within any existing slice it will then be detected by comparing the correspondent calculated and provided hash values. Experiment results show that the suggested method has sufficient sensitivity to detect image tampering whereas being tolerant to even significant brightness and contrast corrections.

Our approach demonstrates that it is possible to use only the most significant 16 bits of the HDR image encoding per pixel to achieve a comparable bad pixel rate on stereo matching.

With the ever increasing size and complexity of logs, the task of analyzing logs has become cumbersome to carry out manually. For this reason, recent research has focused on automatic analysis techniques for large log files. However, log messages are texts with certain formats and it is very challenging for automatic analysis to understand the semantic meanings of log messages. The current state-of-the-art approaches depend on the quality of observed log messages or source code producing these log messages. In this paper, we propose a method GenLog that can extract log templates from stripped executables (neither source code nor debugging information need to be available). GenLog finds all log related functions in a binary through a combined bottom-up and top down slicing method, reconstructs the memory buffers where log messages were constructeStripped X86 Binaries d, and identifies components of log messages using data flow analysis and taint propagation analysis. GenLog can be used to analyze large binary code, and is suitable for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software or dynamic libraries.

The sink will recover the final aggregate with just t shares using CRT. The multi-objective of the proposed technique is to provide data privacy, identity privacy, source location privacy, and route privacy. The solution also mitigates the problem of packet losses associated with the unreliable wireless communication medium by improving the reliability.

In the next generation mobile networks, one of the main benefits that can be used along with these features is core/backhaul SDN-based network virtualization. In this article, we propose a novel shared SDN-based Evolved Packet System (EPS) architecture where a network virtualization controller is utilized to ensure dynamic slicing and sharing of mobile core and backhaul networks among several Mobile Operators (MOs). In the proposed architecture, infrastructure owner that owns the SDN-based network infrastructure can exploit network virtualization benefits of SDN by formulating an appropriate evolved NodeBs (eNodeBs) assignment mechanism among MOs as a consequence of core/backhaul network virtualization. This mechanism uses various scheduling algorithms based on the instantaneous traffic demands of MOs while guaranteeing their own quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In respect to this, we investigate the performance of shared architecture with the use of both QoS-aware and QoS-unaware schedulers through Monte Carlo simulations and compare them with traditional EPS of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks in terms of fairness, capacity and satisfied-MO-ratio and the challenges, opportunities and business perspectives of our proposed architecture are addressed as well.","","978-1-5386-3873-6","10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7980640","Software-Defined Networking;Dynamic Slicing;Shared Mobile Network;Network Virtualization;Virtualization Controller","Virtualization;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Long Term Evolution;Control systems;Logic gates","centralised control;Long Term Evolution;Monte Carlo methods;next generation networks;quality of service;software defined networking;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","dynamic slicing;mobile network infrastructures;business aspects;software-defined networking;hardware abstraction;programmable networking;centralized policy control;next generation mobile networks;backhaul SDN-based network virtualization;evolved packet system;EPS;network virtualization controller;backhaul networks;mobile operators;evolved NodeBs;assignment mechanism;scheduling algorithms;instantaneous traffic demands;quality-of-service;QoS-unaware schedulers;Monte Carlo simulations;Long Term Evolution;LTE networks;satisfied-MO-ratio","","1","","15","","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By resource we mean any entity (physical or virtual) that makes up the IoT system, such as sensors, gateways, network elements, and cloud data stores. Typical user requests for resource provisioning demand end-to-end slices ofan IoT system, and these requests are also dynamic and constantly changing. Meeting such requests using today's approaches is a time-consuming process since such end-to-end slices need to be hardwired together due to the lackof information-centric frameworks to aggregate and control diverse types of resources from IoT, network functions and cloud infrastructures. To that end, in this conceptual paper, we propose an information-centric approach towards IoT resources provisioning and management. By virtualizing access to underlying IoT resources and leveraging APIs to manipulate those resources, our approach proposes techniques to enable IoT system designers to automate resource provisioning and management for users across IoT, network functions and clouds. In doing so, our approach focuses on novel concepts to create and manage end-to-end slices of diverse types of resources from different, distributed infrastructures. In this paper we present SINC -- Slicing IoT, Network Functions, and Clouds -- which enables designers todynamically create/update end-to-end slices of the overall IoT network in order to simultaneously meet multiple user needs.

We propose a novel fault localization method to localize multiple types of faults in SQL predicates, that is based on row-based dynamic slicing and delta debugging. Our method was implemented in a tool called ALTAR, and experiments were performed on two publicly available databases. Our method can be compared with existing fault localization techniques when these are applied to ""drill-down"" in SQL statements. The results showed that ALTAR can discover more types of faults.

Focusing on slicing the radio access network, a slice management entity is required to steer the radio resource management (RRM) so that all of the slices are satisfied and negative inter-slice influences are minimized. The steering of RRM can be done by adjusting slice-specific control parameters in scheduler and admission controller mechanisms. We use a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) framework and train an agent as a slice manager. Simulation results show that such agents are capable of relatively quickly learning how to steer the RRM.

With 5G, slicing concepts at mobile network connections are introduced, allowing operators to divide portions of their network for specific use cases. In addition, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles allow to assign different Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels to different network slices.This paper proposes an SDN-based solution, executable both offline and online, that guarantees the required bandwidth for the emergency flows and maximizes the best-effort flows over the remaining bandwidth based on their priority. The offline model allows to optimize the problem for a batch of flow requests, but is computationally expensive, especially the variant where flows can be split up over parallel paths. For practical, dynamic situations, an online approach is proposed that periodically recalculates the optimal solution for all requested flows, while using shortest path routing and a greedy heuristic for bandwidth allocation for the intermediate flows.Afterwards, the offline approaches are evaluated through simulations while the online approach is validated through physical experiments with SDN switches, both in a scenario with 500 best-effort and 50 emergency flows. The results show that the offline algorithm is able to guarantee the resource allocation for the emergency flows while optimizing the best-effort flows with a sub-second execution time. As a proof-of-concept, a physical setup with Zodiac switches effectively validates the feasibility of the online approach in a realistic setup.","2165-963X","978-3-903176-24-9","10.23919/CNSM46954.2019.9012696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9012696","Network Management;SDN;ILP;LP;Dijkstra;Emergency flows","Bandwidth;Quality of service;Meters;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;5G mobile communication;Videos","bandwidth allocation;emergency services;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication switching;telecommunication traffic","SDN networks;emergency services;mobile network connections;Software-Defined Networking principles;Quality-of-Service levels;network slices;SDN-based solution;emergency flows;best-effort flows;offline model;flow requests;online approach;requested flows;shortest path routing;bandwidth allocation;intermediate flows;offline approaches;SDN switches;offline algorithm;emergency flow prioritization","","1","","35","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This conceptual change in network structure aims to meet the rapid increase in mobile data traffic and connected devices. However, limited free spectrum and dynamic assignment of resources are main concerns when considering the cognitive small cells solution. Therefore, there is a need to map traffic patterns with the number of cognitive small cells to provide an optimized network architecture operating with adequate spectrum resources. This article investigates the case when network densification exceeds the radio resource capacity, causing a large scale overlapping in cell coverage area and used channels. Taking into consideration cognitive network performance characteristics, we identify two spectrum coexistence frameworks, Space Filling and Time Filling, to improve spectrum utilization and scalability for moderately large networks. Simulations show that there is a turning point when network performance starts to decline as the number of cognitive small cells exceeds the shared resources in a site area, subject to a certain load profile. This optimization of network structure, based on spectrum transmission opportunities, brings about a new topic for operators and research communities considering small cells operating in the unlicensed band.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2017.1500258NM","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884953","","Cognitive radio;Macrocell networks;Resource management;Sensors;Microcell networks;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;cognitive radio;resource allocation;telecommunication network planning","spectrum transmission opportunities;network structure optimization;resource sharing;spectrum scalability;time filling;space filling;spectrum utilization;cognitive network performance characteristics;radio resource capacity;cognitive small cell;mobile data traffic;radio resource slicing;ultra-dense small cell deployment;5G wireless network;fifth generation wireless network;ultra-dense wireless network planning","","17","","15","","22 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Advances in technology, such as network connection, hardware platforms, and software design techniques, have empowered Web developers to design Web pages that are highly rich in content and engage users through an interactive experience. However, the performance of Web applications is not ideal today, and many users experience poor quality of service, including long page load times and irregular animations. One of the contributing factors to low performance is the very design of Web applications, particularly Web browsers. In this work, we argue that there are unnecessary computations in today's Web applications, which are completely or most likely wasted. We first describe the potential unnecessary computations at a high level, and then design a profiler based on dynamic backward program slicing that detects such computations. Our profiler reveals that for four different websites, only 45% of dynamically executed instructions are useful in rendering the main page, on average.

Our analysis shows that processing JavaScript codes is the most notable category of unnecessary computations, specifically during page loading. Therefore, such computations are either completely wasted or could be deferred to a later time, i.e., when they are actually needed, thereby providing higher performance and better energy efficiency.","","978-1-7281-0746-2","10.1109/ISPASS.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695651","","Browsers;Web pages;Cascading style sheets;Rendering (computer graphics);Pipelines;User experience;Google","Internet;online front-ends;program slicing;software engineering;Web design","Web applications;Web developers;Web browsers;Web pages;dynamic backward program slicing;profiler design","","","","44","","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Library behaviors are hence an integral part of software behaviors. Analyzing them is as important as analyzing the software itself. However, analyzing libraries is highly challenging due to the lack of source code, implementation in different languages, and complex optimizations. We observe that many Java library functions provide excellent documentation, which concisely describes the functionalities of the functions. We develop a novel technique that can construct models for Java API functions by analyzing the documentation. These models are simpler implementations in Java compared to the original ones and hence easier to analyze. More importantly, they provide the same functionalities as the original functions. Our technique successfully models 326 functions from 14 widely used Java classes. We also use these models in static taint analysis on Android apps and dynamic slicing for Java programs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our models.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-3900-1","10.1145/2884781.2884881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886919","documentation analysis;environment modeling;natural language processing;auto-testing","Libraries;Java;Indexes;Analytical models;Documentation;Software;Generators","application program interfaces;Java;program slicing","automatic model generation;Java API functions;application program interfaces;library behavior;Java library functions;documentation analysis;Java classes;static taint analysis;Android applications;dynamic slicing;Java programs","","13","1","37","","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be cost-effective, a key functional requirement for such infrastructure is enabling the sharing of heterogeneous resources amongst tenants/service providers supporting spatially varying and dynamic user demands. This paper proposes a resource allocation criterion, namely, Share Constrained Slicing (SCS), for slices allocated predefined shares of the network's resources, which extends traditional α-fairness criterion, by striking a balance among inter- and intra-slice fairness vs. overall efficiency. We show that SCS has several desirable properties including slice-level protection, envy-freeness, and load-driven elasticity. In practice, mobile users' dynamics could make the cost of implementing SCS high, so we discuss the feasibility of using a simpler (dynamically) weighted max-min as a surrogate resource allocation scheme. For a setting with stochastic loads and elastic user requirements, we establish a sufficient condition for the stability of the associated coupled network system. Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, we show via extensive simulations that while SCS (and/or the surrogate weighted max-min allocation) provides inter-slice protection, they can achieve improved job delay and/or perceived throughput, as compared to other weighted max-min based allocation schemes whose intra-slice weight allocation is not share-constrained, e.g., traditional max-min or discriminatory processor sharing.","","978-3-903176-20-1","10.23919/WiOPT47501.2019.9144138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144138","","Resource management;Elasticity;Computational modeling;Network slicing;Data analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Stability criteria","cloud computing;data privacy;minimax techniques;mobile computing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","network edge;heterogeneous resources;resource allocation criterion;α-fairness criterion;slice-level protection;load-driven elasticity;mobile users;elastic user requirements;coupled network system;surrogate weighted max-min allocation;inter-slice protection;discriminatory processor sharing;weighted max-min based allocation;intra-slice weight allocation;surrogate resource allocation;intra-slice fairness;share constrained slicing;elastic multiresource network slicing;privacy requirements;data-intensive mobile applications;cloud computing","","1","","33","","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to enhance the efficiency of sorting, multiple AGVs have been used to transport as many express packages as possible in a given time. However, there may exist collisions and deadlocks when two or more AGVs are trying to pass through a shared area at the same time. In this paper, we study collision-free and deadlock-free path planning of multiple AGVs with the objective of minimizing the makespan, that is, the maximum time of the AGVs to finish a round of delivery. To solve the problem, we first propose a candidate path generation algorithm to generate several paths for each AGV, from which a combination of the paths is selected based on optimal path combination selection (OPCS) algorithm, such that the collisions and deadlocks can be minimized. Then, we construct a colored resource-oriented timed Petri net (CROTPN) model for dynamic changing AGV routes after slicing the scheduling period into timeslots. Through Slot-Control policy, the collision and deadlock can be effectively avoided. Our experiment is simulated based on CPN tools. Experiment results show that our method can achieve a high sorting throughput using the least AVGs.","","978-1-5386-9582-1","10.1109/ICARCV.2018.8581060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8581060","path planning;AGV;CROTPN;logistic center;Petri net","System recovery;Loading;Logistics;Petri nets;Path planning;Sorting;Dynamic scheduling","automatic guided vehicles;path planning;Petri nets;sorting","express packages;deadlocks;study collision-free;deadlock-free path planning;maximum time;candidate path generation;optimal path combination selection algorithm;dynamic changing AGV routes;CROTPN based collision-free;logistic center;automated guided vehicle;multiple AGV","","2","","17","","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The configuration of these devices is manually done by system operators. Besides laborious and error-prone, this configuration also limits the client customization and configuration of the network. One way out of this lack of customization is the separation of control and data planes from these devices. The Software Defined Networks (SDNs) propose the separation of planes with the flexibility to create and manage applications by network operators, enabling this operators to reduce network cost by globally optimizing the network resources, reducing the staff needed to configure the network and enabling less service level agreement (SLA) violation. SDN can also help operators to maximize their profit by generating more revenue through mechanisms to increase availability, increase failure resiliency, maximizing throughput, fast dynamic reprovisioning and enabling network virtualization. The objective of this paper is to propose a Software Defined Optical Networks Slicing Architecture (SONA) that allows defining components such as topology manager, inventory manager, slice manager and path provisioner, enabling Optical Networks partitioning. It proved to be capable of managing an optical network, by managing network nodes inventory, managing different slices over the same physical network, provisioning a path on a given slice over the physical network.

As such, there is a wide gap related with the impact that such slicing-based procedures will exert over mobility management processes for seamless mobility support while the devices, network or services move both physically (i.e., change their network point of attachment) as well as virtually (i.e., between slices).

The deployment of smart networks, which are supported by SRA (Smart Resource Allocation) among different networks and CUA (Cognitive User Access) among different users, is deemed a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we propose a framework to transform HetNets to smart networks by leveraging WBD (Wireless Big Data), CR (Cognitive Radio) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) techniques. CR and NFV support resource slicing in spectrum, physical layers, and network layers, while WBD is used to design intelligent mechanisms for resource mapping and traffic prediction through powerful AI (Artificial Intelligence) methods. We analyze the characteristics of WBD and review possible AI methods to be utilized in smart networks. In particular, the potential of WBD is revealed through high level view on SRA, which intelligently maps radio and network resources to each network for meeting the dynamic traffic demand, as well as CUA, which allows mobile users to access the best available network with manageable cost, yet achieving target QoS (Quality-of-Service) or QoE.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0002-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932162","wireless big data;cognitive radio network;network function virtualization;software defined network;machine learning;smart radio allocation;cognitive user sccess","","","","","2","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"
