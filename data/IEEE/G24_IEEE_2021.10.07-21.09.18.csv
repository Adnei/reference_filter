In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, achieving effective network slicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges, particularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the fast-changing network topology. By leveraging the widely deployed LTE infrastructures, we propose a semi-decentralized network slicing framework in this paper based on the C-V2X Mode-4 standard to provide customized network slices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial information of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying network situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each slice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB, each vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is realized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is a convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared to the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior knowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks.

However, effective slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) is very challenging due to the diverse QoS requirements and dynamic conditions in the 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;quality of service;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling","model-based control;transfer learning;radio resource allocation;adaptive control strategy;heterogeneous quality of service;5th generation-beyond networks;next generation NodeB-level slicing;autonomic RAN slicing control;self-learning RAN slicing control;network slice;gNodeB-level;packet scheduling level slicing;network-level slicing;network conditions;slicing control performance;network resources;QoS requirements;radio access network;6G networks;5G networks;service provisioning;intelligent self-sustained RAN slicing framework","","1","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents.

In this paper, we present a new dynamic edge/fog network slicing scheme (EFNS) in which tenants can temporarily lease back to the Infrastructure Provider (InP) unused resources to serve demands exceeding its current resources in stock. To efficiently use the resources, tenants can also lease their subscribers' terminals when idle to act as fog nodes augmenting the infrastructure and service capability of the InP. Our goal is to find an optimal slice request admission policy, which includes slices with augmented resources, to maximize the long-term revenue of the InP. A semi-Markov decision process is used to model the arrival of slice requests by taking into account the dynamics of users' demands and availability of resources. To find the optimal policy under uncertain resource demands, a Q-learning (Q-EFNS) algorithm is developed. Additionally, to improve the convergence time and reduce the computational complexity of Q-learning in large-scale scenarios, a Deep reinforcement learning (DQ-EFNS) algorithm and an enhancement based on a Deep Dueling (Dueling DQ-EFNS) algorithm are presented. Finally, simulation results show improvements in the range between 20% to 60% by our algorithms compared to conventional fixed network slicing when only 8% of the subscribers act as fog nodes. Besides, by using Dueling DQ-EFNS, the optimal slice request admission policy is obtained in just a few iterations.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322631","Dynamic resource allocation;edge/fog network slicing;deep Q-learning;dueling DQN","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Uncertainty","6G mobile communication;computer network management;deep learning (artificial intelligence);distributed processing;Markov processes;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","future 6G wireless networks;storage resources;semiMarkov decision process;optimal policy;dynamic edge network slicing;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;dynamic fog network slicing;computing resources;radio resources;infrastructure provider;unused resources lease back;subscriber terminals leasing;long-term revenue;Q-learning algorithm;DQ-EFNS algorithm;deep dueling algorithm;InP","","","","12","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","1","","34","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to use DQN algorithm to solve this problem, which can perceive changes in the environment and make dynamic decisions. Under each decision, we need to calculate the reward value of DQN, so we divide the problem into the core side and the access side. Then the dynamic knapsack algorithm and the link mapping algorithm are used to obtain the reward. The simulation results show that the average access rate of DQN scheme is higher than 97%.

This problem is non-trivial in a dynamic, virtualized environment. In this paper, we first use stochastic network calculus (SNC) to study the end-to-end delay bound with given traffic demand and resources.

In particular, at a given time slot, the system makes online decisions on the request admission and scheduling, UAV dispatching, and resource slicing for different services. To characterize the impact of those parameters, we construct a time-averaged queue stability criteria by taking queue backlogs of all services into consideration, and formulate a system revenue function which incorporates the time-averaged system throughput and UAV dispatching cost. The objective is to maximize the system revenue while stabilizing the time-averaged queue, which falls into the scope of Lyapunov optimization theory. By bounding the drift-plus-penalty, the original problem can be decoupled into four independent subproblems, each of which is readily solved. The merits of our control framework are three-fold: 1) the system is able to admit and process as many requests as possible (i.e., maximizing the time-averaged throughput); 2) the time-averaged UAV dispatching cost is minimized; and 3) service queues are stabilized in the long-term. Extensive simulations are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the control framework can effectively achieve the system revenue maximization and queueing stabilization. Moreover, it can balance the trade-off among system throughput, UAV dispatching cost, and queueing states via parameter tuning.

Available communication resources (frequency-time blocks and transmit powers) and computational resources (processor usage) are allocated to stochastic arrivals of network slice requests. Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput, computational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible, it is served with available communication and computational resources allocated over its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some of the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that can optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for network slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the network utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing requests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational constraints. Results show that reinforcement learning provides major improvements in the 5G network utility relative to myopic, random, and first come first served solutions. While reinforcement learning sustains scalable performance as the number of served users increases, it can also be effectively used to assign resources to network slices when 5G needs to share the spectrum with incumbent users that may dynamically occupy some of the frequency-time blocks.","2378-4873","978-1-7281-6339-0","10.1109/CAMAD50429.2020.9209299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209299","5G security;network slicing;radio access network;network optimization;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Resource management;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Optimization;Throughput;Bit error rate","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","frequency-time blocks;reinforcement learning;dynamic resource optimization;5G radio access network slicing;dynamic resource allocation;network slice requests;Q-learning solution;computational constraints","","2","","22","","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under dynamic traffic load, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by numerous variables. In this article, we investigate the reconfiguration within a core network slice with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This problem is also intractable by using conventional Deep Q Network (DQN), as it has a multi-dimensional discrete action space which is difficult to explore efficiently. To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose to exploit Branching Dueling Q-network which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. Based on the discrete BDQ network, we develop an intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm (INSRA).

By leveraging SDN and NVF techniques, it enables the coexistence of several heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs) on top of the same physical infrastructure. Despite the advantages it brings to network operators, network slicing raises a major challenge: Resource allocation of VNs, also known as the virtual network embedding problem (VNEP). VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics.

Slicing divides a physical network into multiple dedicated logical networks to meet the requirements of diverse use cases. Efficient slice deployment algorithms are critical in reducing network operators' costs and energy consumption and in providing users better service. Many researchers have focused on static deployment when investigating network slices, effectively ignoring network operators' requirements for the dynamic deployment and expansion of such slices. In this paper, we first construct a joint optimization problem of cost and energy consumption. Then, we propose a prediction-assisted adaptive network slice expansion algorithm to deploy network slices dynamically. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts. First, we devise a Holt-Winters (HW) prediction algorithm to determine traffic demand for network slices. This method is intended to avoid frequent changes in network topology. Second, we propose a virtual network function (VNF) adaptive scaling strategy to reasonably determine the number of VNFs and resources required for network slices to avoid resource wastage. Finally, we develop a proactive online algorithm to deploy network slices. This method deploys network slices reasonably via the VNF deployment algorithm and link-routing algorithm to ensure slices' service requirements. Resource capacity and delay requirements are also considered in our evaluation to ensure that network costs and energy consumption are minimized. We then perform a series of simulation experiments to compare the proposed method's performance to state-of-the-art dynamic network slicing technologies. Ultimately, our solution is deemed a suitable candidate for dynamic deployment of 5G network slices; the solution demonstrates advantages of high resource utilization, low deployment costs, and low energy consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010623","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901043,61872044); research project 2020KYNH104 of Beijing Information Science and Technology University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144576","Adaptive scaling;dynamic deployment;energy consumption;link routing;network slice;virtual network function","Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Energy consumption;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Delays;Adaptive systems","5G mobile communication;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","fifth-generation mobile networks;multiple dedicated logical networks;efficient slice deployment algorithms;network operators;prediction-assisted adaptive network slice expansion algorithm;dynamic network slicing technologies;dynamic network slice scaling;Holt-Winters prediction algorithm","","1","","37","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under traffic uncertainty, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by the numerous variables. In this paper, we investigate network slice reconfiguration with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address the curse of dimensionality of the problem, we propose to incorporate the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) into DRL, to avoid some unnecessary calculations of Q-value by separating the Q-network into a shared value branch and a number of distributed advantage branches. Furthermore, the value branch and the advantage branch of each dimension are aggregated to derive the corresponding dimension's sub-Q-value. Then the best reconfiguration action is composed of the subactions in individual dimensions which are selected by €-greedy policy. Finally, we design an intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy based on BDQ and extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed slice reconfiguration policy.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148848","","Resource management;Substrates;Bandwidth;Numerical models;Machine learning;Quality of service;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;branching dueling q-network;connectivity services;diverse usage scenarios;network slicing;dynamic network slice reconfiguration;intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy;reconfiguration action;advantage branch;distributed advantage branches;shared value branch;DRL;long-term resource consumption;extremely high computational complexity;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;network resource utilization","","1","","13","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work provides an optimal and fast resource slicing solution under such dynamics by leveraging the latest advances in deep learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel system model which allows the network provider to effectively allocate its combinatorial resources, i.e., spectrum, computing, and storage, to various classes of users. To allocate resources to users while taking into account the dynamic demands of users and resources constraints of the network provider, we employ a semi-Markov decision process framework. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy for the network provider without requiring environment parameters, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is adopted. Although this algorithm can maximize the revenue of the network provider, its convergence to the optimal policy is particularly slow, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach using an advanced deep Q-learning technique, called deep dueling that can achieve the optimal policy at few thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can improve the long-term average return of the network provider up to 40% compared with other current approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761907","","Network slicing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;resource allocation","real-time network slicing;resource slicing solution;semiMarkov decision process framework;uncertain demand;time network slicing;advanced deep Q-learning technique;optimal policy;optimal resource allocation policy;combinatorial resources;uncertain customer demands;network resources;real-time dynamics;deep learning approach","","2","","18","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional model-based optimization or queueing theoretic modeling becomes intractable with the high reliability, and stringent bandwidth and latency requirements imposed by 5G.

In order to solve the complex requirements and provide customized services, a new network architecture is needed. To change the traditional control mode used in the traditional network architecture, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is proposed. First, SDN divides the network into the Control Plane and Data Plane and then delegates the network management authority to the controller of the control layer. This allows centralized control of connections of a large number of devices. Second, SDN can help realizing the network slicing in the aspect of network layer. With the network slicing technology proposed by 5G, it can cut the 5G network out of multiple virtual networks and each virtual network is to support the needs of diverse users. In this work, we design and develop a network slicing framework. The contributions of this article are two folds. First, through SDN technology, we develop to provide the corresponding end-to-end (E2E) network slicing for IoT applications with different requirements. Second, we develop a dynamic network slice resource scheduling and management method based on SDN to meet the services' requirements with time-varying characteristics.

The impact of delay constraints may lead to rejection of demands, resulting in low resource utilization of network resources. This is especially severe when dynamic traffic is considered. Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios.

Each node relies on harvested energy from the surrounding environment to provide computational services to local users. We propose the concept of dynamic network slicing, in which a regional orchestrator coordinates workload distribution among local fog nodes, providing partitions/slices of energy and computational resources to support a specific type of service with certain quality-of-service guarantees. The resources allocated to each slice can be dynamically adjusted according to service demands and energy availability. A stochastic overlapping coalition-formation game is developed to investigate the distributed cooperation and joint network slicing between fog nodes under randomly fluctuating energy harvesting and workload arrival processes. We observe that the overall processing capacity of the fog computing network can be improved by allowing fog nodes to maintain a belief function about the unknown state and the private information of other nodes. An algorithm based on a belief-state partially observable Markov decision process is proposed to achieve the optimal resource slicing structure among all fog nodes. We describe how to implement our proposed dynamic network slicing within the 3GPP network sharing architecture and evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the real base station (BS) location data of a real cellular system with over 200 BSs deployed in the city of Dublin. Our numerical results show that our framework can significantly improve the workload processing capability of fog computing networks.

Future access points (APs) are expected to have self-organizational capabilities, able to deal with large configuration spaces in order to dynamically configure each slice. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge.

Particularly, we jointly optimize slice request admission in the long-term and resource allocation in the short-term to maximize the operator's average revenue. By employing the Lyapunov optimization technique, we develop an algorithm without requiring any prior-knowledge of traffic distributions, referred to as the DNSRA, to solve the problem. To reduce the computational complexity of directly solving the DNSRA, we decouple the optimization variables for efficient algorithm design. By this, the strategies for user association and CPU-cycle frequency are obtained in closed forms, respectively. Power allocation and subcarriers assignment are obtained by employing the successive convex approximation approach. Meanwhile, we develop a heuristic algorithm to obtain the dynamic slice request admission decision. Simulation results show that the proposed DNSRA can strike a flexible balance between the average revenue and the average delay, and can significantly increase the operator's revenue against existing schemes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2992607","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFE0126000); Key Program of NSFC-Tongyong Union Foundation(grant numbers:U1636209); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902292); Key Research and Development Programs of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY13-07,2019ZDLGY13-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901367); Beijing Wuzi University Youth Research Fund Project(grant numbers:2017XJQN07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087909","Mobile edge computing (MEC);network slicing;traffic variations;operator's revenue;resource allocation","Resource management;Mobile handsets;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization","approximation theory;computational complexity;convex programming;distributed processing;mobile computing;power aware computing;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","dynamic network slicing;resource allocation;mobile edge computing systems;resource slicing;power allocation;mobile devices;MEC systems;heuristic algorithm;slice request admission;energy scheduling;successive convex approximation;CPU-cycle frequency;dynamic slice request admission decision;computational complexity;DNSRA;Lyapunov optimization technique;longer-term revenue;revenue model","","10","","32","IEEE","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The state of the radio access network changes from moment to moment and automatic control of network slicing is necessary to respond to service requirements in real time. Automatic control is applied using deep reinforcement learning that can learn optimal control by repeating trial and error. In this paper, we propose a method to allocate radio resources that satisfy the service requirements regardless of the number of slices using deep reinforcement learning. The proposed method flexibly controls multiple slices by observing the state of one slice and calling a model that controls one slice multiple times.

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem by considering the varying service demands as the environment state and the allocated resources as the environment action. In order to reduce the effects of the annoying randomness and noise embedded in the received service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio (SSR) and spectrum efficiency (SE), we primarily propose generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the action-value distribution driven by minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated action-value distribution and the target action-value distribution. We put forward a reward-clipping mechanism to stabilize GAN-DDQN training against the effects of widely-spanning utility values. Moreover, we further develop Dueling GAN-DDQN, which uses a specially designed dueling generator, to learn the action-value distribution by estimating the state-value distribution and the action advantage function.

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computationally-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (5GAuRA)(grant numbers:675806); Secretaria d’Universitats i Recerca del Departament d’Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2017 SGR 376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","19","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Q-th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds. These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. Numerical results on various slice-level resources show that SFL enables SLA enforcement while significantly reducing the overhead compared to both state-of-the-art FedAvg and centralized constrained deep learning schemes.

However, allocating bandwidth in a finer resolution usually implies larger action space, and unfortunately DQL fails to quickly converge in this case. In this letter, we introduce discrete normalized advantage functions (DNAF) into DQL, by separating the Q-value function as a state-value function term and an advantage term and exploiting a deterministic policy gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to avoid the unnecessary calculation of Q-value for every stateaction pair.

In a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNets) with network slicing functions, due to the dense deployment of base stations (BSs) and the mobility of user equipments (UEs), dynamically switching network slices (NSs) is necessary for better system performance. This paper models the handoff problem of end-to-end NS as a Markov decision process (MDP) maximizing the utility related to the UE's profit of being served, the handoff cost and the outage penalty. Both the states of the radio access network resources and the core network resources of each end-to-end NS are considered. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is adopted as the solution, and a double deep Q network (DQN) based NS handoff algorithm is designed. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the DQN used to make handoff decisions and show that compared with typical handoff algorithms, the algorithm we proposed performs the best from the aspect of the cumulative reward designed in this paper.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417502","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417502","","Training;Network slicing;Wireless networks;System performance;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Switches","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;telecommunication network reliability","network slicing functions;end-to-end NS;radio access network resources;core network resources;deep reinforcement learning;double deep Q network based NS;end-to-end network slicing;traditional wireless networks;heterogeneous cellular network","","","","17","","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we consider the delay requirements of certain services in the power grid. First, we analyze the security issues in network slicing and model the 5G core network slicing supply as a mixed integer linear programming problem. On this basis, a heuristic algorithm is proposed. According to the topological properties, resource utilization and delay of the slice nodes, the importance of them is sorted using the VIKOR method. In the slice link configuration stage, the shortest path algorithm is used to obtain the slice link physical path. Considering the delay of the slice link, a strategy for selecting the physical path is proposed.

This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and intercell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed radio resource slicing framework outperforms the two other resource slicing schemes in terms of low communication overhead, high spectrum utilization, and high aggregate network utility.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2018.2859740","Huawei Technologies Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419289","5G;heterogeneous wireless networks;NFV;SDN;radio resource slicing;spectrum sharing;data and M2M services;resource utilization;differentiated QoS guarantee","Quality of service;Bandwidth;Wireless networks;Resource management;Machine-to-machine communications;Network function virtualization","cellular radio;concave programming;quality of service;radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;search problems;software defined networking;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","two-tier heterogeneous wireless network;dynamic radio resource slicing framework;wireless network function virtualization;radio spectrum resources;machine-to-machine service;network load dynamics;optimal bandwidth slicing ratios;optimal BS-device association patterns;network utility maximization problem;base stations;traffic statistics;heterogeneous BS;alternative concave search;ACS algorithm;biconcave maximization problem;spectrum sharing;network function virtualization;software-defined networking;quality-of-service;intercell interference","","55","","35","","25 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network slicing has been envisaged as an efficient technology to meet these diverse demands. In this paper, we propose a dynamic virtual resources allocation scheme based on the radio access network (RAN) slicing for uplink communications to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS). To maximum the weighted-sum transmission rate performance under delay constraint, formulate a joint optimization problem of subchannel allocation and power control as an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. Based on the equivalent Bellman equation, the optimal control policy is first derived by the value iteration algorithm. However, the optimal policy suffers from the widely known curse-of-dimensionality problem. To address this problem, the linear value function approximation (approximate dynamic programming) is adopted. Then, the subchannel allocation Q-factor is decomposed into the per-slice Q-factor. Furthermore, the Q-factor and Lagrangian multipliers are updated by the use of an online stochastic learning algorithm. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can meet the delay requirements and improve the user transmission rate compared with baseline schemes.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2020.2990072","National Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2018YFB1004800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61727802,61872184); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:30920021127); State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University(grant numbers:ISN19-06); National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University; Russian Foundation Basic Research(grant numbers:19-37-90037,19-37-90105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078057","Network slicing;RAN slicing;constrained Markov decision process (CMDP);resource allocation","Resource management;Network slicing;Wireless communication;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;5G mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms","5G mobile communication;function approximation;infinite horizon;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;multi-access systems;optimal control;optimisation;power control;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;stochastic processes;telecommunication computing;telecommunication control","fifth generation communication;QoS;constrained Markov decision process;Bellman equation;Lagrangian multiplier;user transmission rate;per-slice Q-factor;dynamic programming;linear value function approximation;curse-of-dimensionality problem;optimal policy suffers;optimal control policy;equivalent Bellman equation;infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process problem;power control;subchannel allocation;joint optimization problem;delay constraint;weighted-sum transmission rate performance;quality-of-service;uplink communications;radio access network;dynamic virtual resources allocation scheme;high transmission rate;massive connection;heterogeneous services;wireless communication;network slicing;dynamic virtual resource allocation","","5","","33","CCBY","24 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing method that flexibly allocates RAN resources using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In RANs, the number of slices controlled by a base station fluctuates in terms of user ingress and egress from the base station coverage area and service switching on the respective sets of user equipment. Therefore, when resource allocation depends on the number of slices, resources cannot be allocated when the number of slices changes. We consider a method that makes optimal-resource allocation independent of the number of slices. Resource allocation is optimized using DRL, which learns the best action for a state through trial and error. To achieve independence from the number of slices, we show a design for a model that manages resources on a one-slice-by-one-agent basis using Ape-X, which is a DRL method. In Ape-X, because agents can be employed in parallel, models that learn various environments can be generated through trial and error of multiple environments. In addition, we design a model that satisfies the slicing requirements without over-allocating resources. Based on this design, it is possible to optimally allocate resources independently of the number of slices by changing the number of agents. In the evaluation, we test multiple scenarios and show that the mean satisfaction of the slice requirements is approximately 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986050","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057705","Deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;RAN slicing;resource management","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Machine learning;Scalability;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication switching","flexible resource block allocation;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing method;RAN resources;optimal-resource allocation;one-slice-by-one-agent basis;fifth-generation mobile communications;RAN slicing method;Ape-X","","7","","34","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load.

Therein, demand-aware allocation is of significant importance to network slicing. In this paper, we consider a scenario that contains several slices in one base station on sharing the same bandwidth. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is leveraged to solve this problem by regarding the varying demands and the allocated bandwidth as the environment state and action, respectively. In order to obtain better quality of experience (QoE) satisfaction ratio and spectrum efficiency (SE), we propose generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the distribution of state-action values. Furthermore, we estimate the distributions by approximating a full quantile function, which can make the training error more controllable. In order to protect the stability of GAN-DDQN's training process from the widely-spanning utility values, we also put forward a reward-clipping mechanism.

This allows the network to support the diverse requirements of different IoT verticals ranging from connected vehicles to smart agriculture. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network slice assignment scheme for software-defined IoT networks, where each application type is assigned to a distinct slice controller depending on its QoS requirements. We formulate the optimal mapping between network slices and slice controllers as an integer programming problem, and show that the proposed scheme is capable of significantly reducing the number of QoS violations compared to existing controller mapping schemes. Further, we present a scheduling scheme to dynamically re-compute the optimal mapping, based on optimal stopping theory, while taking into consideration the temporal variations in traffic and link latencies.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are two of the key enabler technologies in 5G networks that can be used to optimize the allocation of the network resources and guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications. As traditional model-based optimization techniques generally end up with NP-hard and strongly non-convex and nonlinear mathematical programming formulations, in this article, we introduce a model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the resource allocation problem in MEC-enabled IoV networks based on network slicing. Furthermore, the solution uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable better exploitation of the scarce channel resources. The considered problem addresses jointly the channel and power allocation, the slice selection, and the vehicle selection (vehicle grouping). We model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then we solve it using DRL with the well-known deep Q learning (DQL) algorithm.

Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture that incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the mobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a scalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS to autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice orchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken by the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and reactive resource provisioning techniques. The proposed resource dimensioning heuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which consists of an open network of G/G/m queues.

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","27","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed service deployment algorithm achieves 100% in terms of both overall resource utilization and admission for higher priority slices in some scenarios in bandwidth-constrained contexts, which cannot be achieved by other existing schemes due to priority constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044951","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-108713RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294018","5G;network slicing;network services;quality of service;virtual network function;SKM","Quality of service;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Network slicing;Network topology;Routing","5G mobile communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","quality of service;QoS;network function virtualization technology;end-to-end network slices;intelligent resource allocation algorithms;network resources;NFV architecture;resource allocation strategy;resource utilization optimization;service deployment algorithm;priority slices;NFV aware network service;squatting-kicking model;5G mobile communication;SKM;intelligent Network slicing","","","","46","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate the realization approach of fog RAN slicing, where two network slice instances for hotspot and vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios are concerned and orchestrated. In particular, the framework for RAN slicing is formulated as an optimization problem of jointly tackling content caching and mode selection, in which the time-varying channel and unknown content popularity distribution are characterized. Due to the different users' demands and the limited resources, the complexity of original optimization problem is significant high, which makes traditional optimization approaches hard to be directly applied. To deal with this dilemma, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, whose core idea is that the cloud server makes proper decisions on the content caching and mode selection to maximize the reward performance under the dynamical channel state and cache status. The simulation results demonstrate the performance in terms of hit ratio and sum transmit rate can be significantly improved by the proposal.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.2965927","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003,61925101,61831002,61901044); State Major Science and Technology Special Project(grant numbers:2018ZX03001025,2018ZX033001023); 03 Special Project and 5G Program of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20192ABC03A041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:JQ18016); National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962338","Fog radio access network;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Computer architecture;Resource management;Radio access networks;Optimization","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;time-varying channels;wireless channels","vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios;5G;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;optimization problem;content popularity distribution;content caching;network slice;radio access network slicing;core network;fog-RAN slicing","","10","","44","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to be independently managed by different players (tenants), slices need to be logically isolated from each other. As some of the applications envisioned for 5G networks are quite critical from performance point of view, a static slicing of resources, where isolation is not only logical but also physical, may appear a natural solution. However, the price to pay in terms of resource overprovisioning can be high, and therefore dynamic allocation strategies, based on optimized resource sharing, are alternative solutions. In this work, we propose an optimization framework to compare the two resource allocation schemes and define a metric to quantify the slicing gain.

The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP.

Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is challenging. In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform. The performance of EdgeSlice is evaluated through both experiments and trace-driven simulations.

As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This chapter identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal‐level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.","","9781119723912","10.1002/9781119723950.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9536303.pdf&bkn=9536219&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Training data;Sensors","","","","","","","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

One of the major concerns in the RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge. In this paper, we propose a RAN runtime slicing system through which the operation and behavior of the underlying RAN could be customized and controlled to meet slice requirements.

Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture for multiple operators and cloud providers, with a new proof of business consensus protocol to ensure incentive and fairness.

Thus, the growing research on cellular network monitoring and prediction aims for ensuring a satisfied user-base and fulfillment of service level agreements. The scope of this study is to develop an approach for predicting the cellular link throughput of end-users, with a goal to benchmark the performance of network slices. First, we report and analyze a measurement study involving real-life cases, such as driving in urban, sub-urban, and rural areas, as well as tests in large crowded areas. Second, we develop machine learning models using lower-layer metrics, describing the radio environment, to predict the available throughput. The models are initially validated on the LTE network and then applied to a non-standalone 5G network. Finally, we suggest scaling the proposed model into the future standalone 5G network.

In this scenario, PN resource utilization can be improved by introducing advanced orchestration functionalities that can intelligently assign and redistribute resources among the slices of different tenants according to the temporal variation of the VN resource requirements. This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues. The benefits of dynamic slicing come at a cost in terms of service degradation (i.e., when not all the resources required by a VN can be provided), but the paper shows that the service degradation level introduced by the proposed solutions is very small.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000A77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273270","5G transport;Dynamic slicing;IP over WDM;Multi-tenant networks;Network virtualization;Software defined networking","Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Optical fibers","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;software defined networking","dynamic slicing approach;multitenant 5G transport networks;physical network resource utilization;orchestration functionality;software defined networking;network slicing;virtual networks;mixed integer linear programming formulations;heuristic algorithms","","28","","","","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though the architectural framework and the elements of abstraction and orchestration mechanisms have been defined, the dynamic orchestration of resources based on them entails the adoption of existing sophisticated control techniques, or the design of new ones for the specific environment. In the present paper, we address the problem of load balancing among multiple network service chains (which represent network slice instantiations of a Network Service Provider referring to a specific vertical application) originating from different Points of Presence (PoPs). For scalability reasons, we want to maintain the problem within an informationally decentralized setting, where each PoP has the knowledge of the aggregate workload generated by the slice users accessing through it, but not of that of the other PoPs (to avoid the exchange of information for control purposes). By taking also into account power consumption policies of the Infrastructure Provider, we find a set of candidate team-optimal solutions to this load-balancing problem, which are characterized by piecewise-linear functions, and compare their performance with that of other resource allocation strategies.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644472","Network Functions Virtualization;Network Slices;Load Balancing;Network Energy Efficiency;Team Decision Theory","5G mobile communication;Load management;Energy consumption;Servers;Resource management;Cloud computing;Containers","computer network reliability;resource allocation;virtualisation","virtualized environment;orchestration mechanisms;multiple network service chains;PoP;network service provider;virtual network slice instantiations;dynamic network slice instantiations;5G networks;dynamic resource orchestration;points of presence;power consumption;piecewise-linear functions;resource allocation strategies;decentralized scalable dynamic load balancing problem","","1","","21","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party.

In many 5G use cases, network requirements vary over time and CSPs must dynamically adapt network slices to satisfy the contractual network slice QoS, cooperating and using each others’ resources, e.g. when resources of a single CSP are not sufficient or suitable to maintain all it’s current SLAs. While this need for dynamic cross-CSP cooperation is widely recognized, realization of this need is not yet possible due to gaps both in business processes and in technical capabilities.In this paper, we present a 5GZORRO approach to dynamic cross-CSP slice scaling. Our approach both enables CSPs to collaborate, providing security and trust with smart multi-party contracts, and facilitates thus achieved collaboration to enable resource sharing across multiple administrative domains, either during slice establishment or when already existing slice needs to expand or shrink. Our approach allows automating both business and technical processes involved in dynamic lifecycle management of cross-CSP network slices, following ETSI’s Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) closed-loop architecture, and relying on resource-sharing Marketplace, Distributed Ledger (DL), and Operational Data Lake.

Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic- aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low- priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation.

Then, we propose a Hierarchical Auction and Dynamic Programming based Resource Allocation (HA&DP-RA) algorithm to allocate resources for the slices. The dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to obtain a stable solution.

However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler’s Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler’s full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup.

However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks.

The flexible programmability of network slicing and the decentralization of MEC facilitate the deployment of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). The caching feature of ICN can provide users with low-latency data services. Although many existing works have addressed the cache deployment problem or the cache optimization problem, most of them do not consider the issue of caching resource allocation in the dynamic and hierarchical environment. Dynamic deployment of cache nodes can improve the operator’s revenue as much as possible while accurately allocating the caching resources can reduce the user-requested latency. Therefore, in this study, a problem of the operator’s expected revenue maximization is presented in an environment combining dynamic deployment of the MECs and the caching-enabled node ICN-Gateway (ICN-GW). To solve this problem, we propose an optimal stopping theory (OST)-based dynamic hierarchical caching resources allocation (ODH-CRA) algorithm. The algorithm consists of three parts. Firstly, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution is proposed to determine the optimal deployment of the MECs. This method determines the optimal location and number of the MECs by considering deployment costs and service requirement costs synthetically. Secondly, a redeployment technique based on the OST is proposed to determine the best redeployment time of the MECs according to the values of latency violations and the service latency requirements. Finally, an improved elite genetic algorithm (IEGA) is proposed to find the optimal solution of the hierarchical caching resource allocation. This method searches the optimal scheme by maximizing the operator’s revenue joint caching costs and energy consumption. Ultimately, we perform a series of simulation experiments to compare the proposed method’s performance to dynamic and hierarchical methods. Our solution can effectively reduce the latency for users’ requesting, improve the revenue of ICN Communication Service Provider (ICSP), and provide an effective caching resource allocation scheme for the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116602","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872044,61901043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552913","Network slice;MEC;ICN;hierarchical caching resource allocation;dynamic deployment","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Costs;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Network slicing","","","","","","40","CCBY","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience.

The different slices' tenants (i.e. logical operators) are dynamically allocated isolated portions of physical resource blocks (PRBs), baseband processing resources, backhaul capacity as well as data forwarding elements (DFE) and SDN controller connections. By invoking massive key performance indicators (KPIs) datasets stemming from a live cellular network endowed with traffic probes, we first introduce a low-complexity slices' traffics predictor based on a soft gated recurrent unit (GRU). We then build-at each virtual network function-joint multi-slice deep neural networks (DNNs) and train them to estimate the required resources based on the traffic per slice, while not violating two service level agreement (SLA), namely, violation rate-based SLA and resource bounds-based SLA.

The next-generation mobile networks heavily rely on virtualized infrastructure, and network slicing has emerged as a key enabler to support different virtualized services and applications in the 5G network. However, allocating network slices efficiently while providing a minimum guaranteed level of service, as well as providing defense against the threat of malicious co-residency in a mobile core network, is challenging. To address these questions, in our previous work, we proposed an optimization model to allocate slices. It provided a static and manual allocation of slices. In this work, we analyze the defense against the malicious co-residency using our optimization-based allocation, and we extend our work to dynamically allocate slices. We propose a dynamic slice allocation framework for the 5G core network. The proposed framework provides user-interaction to request slices and any required services that need to run on a slice(s). It can accept a single or multiple allocation requests, and it dynamically allocates them. Additionally, the framework allocates slices in a balanced fashion across available resources. We compare our framework with the First Come First Serve and First Available allocation scheme.","","978-1-7281-5628-6","10.1109/ISNCC49221.2020.9297185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9297185","5G slicing;network slicing;5G availability;5G optimization;slice allocation;co-location","Delays;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Optimization;Network slicing;Servers;Side-channel attacks","5G mobile communication;optimisation;queueing theory;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;virtualisation","first come first serve scheme;first available allocation scheme;dynamic slice allocation;virtualized services;static allocation;mobile core network;network slicing;virtualized infrastructure;next-generation mobile networks;virtualized networks;sliced 5G core networks;proactive slice allocation;multiple allocation requests;single allocation requests;dynamic slice allocation framework;optimization-based allocation;malicious co-residency;manual allocation","","","","21","","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid developments of deep learning techniques, it is critical to take the security concern into account when applying the algorithms. While machine learning offers significant advantages for 6G, AI models’ security is normally ignored. Due to the many applications in the real world, security is a vital part of the algorithms. This paper proposes a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. The main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G applications for mmWave beam prediction. We also present the adversarial learning mitigation method’s performance for 6G security in millimeter-wave beam prediction application with fast gradient sign method attack.

Consequently, different objectives, such as high throughput and low latency, need to be achieved in terms of service, and resource allocation must be designed and optimized accordingly. However, considering the dynamics and uncertainty that inherently exist in wireless network environments, conventional approaches for service and resource management that require complete and perfect knowledge of the systems are inefficient or even inapplicable.

We first overview fundamental concepts of DRL and then review related works that use DRL to address various issues in 5G networks.

Second, we design an online algorithm that controls the slice admission based on their priorities, the arrival and departure characteristics, and the available resources. To mitigate system overloading, our framework dynamically adjusts resources allocated to low priority slices, thereby reducing the dropping probability of new slice requests. The proposed algorithm offers outstanding advantages over traditional static approaches by automatically adapting the controller decisions to the system changes.

DeepCog forecasts the capacity needed to accommodate future traffic demands within individual network slices while accounting for the operator's desired balance between resource overprovisioning (i.e., allocating resources exceeding the demand) and service request violations (i.e., allocating less resources than required). To achieve its objective, DeepCog hinges on a deep learning architecture that is explicitly designed for capacity forecasting. Comparative evaluations with real-world measurement data prove that DeepCog's tight integration of machine learning into resource orchestration allows for substantial (50% or above) reduction of operating expenses with respect to resource allocation solutions based on state-of-the-art mobile traffic predictors.

In this paper, the structure and the protocols of NWDAF that are defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard documents are first described. Then, cell-based synthetic data set for 5G networks based on the fields defined by the 3GPP specifications is generated. Further, some anomalies are added to this data set (e.g., suddenly increasing traffic in a particular cell), and then these anomalies within each cell, subscriber category, and user equipment are classified. Afterward, three ML models, namely, linear regression, long-short term memory, and recursive neural networks are implemented to study behaviour information estimation (e.g., anomalies in the network traffic) and network load prediction capabilities of NWDAF. For the prediction of network load, three different models are used to minimize the mean absolute error, which is calculated by subtracting the actual generated data from the model prediction value. For the classification of anomalies, two ML models are used to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, namely, logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting. According to the simulation results, neural network algorithms outperform linear regression in network load prediction, whereas the tree-based gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression in anomaly detection. These estimations are expected to increase the performance of the 5G network through NWDAF.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143579","Handover;machine learning;NWDAF;5G networks","5G mobile communication;Cellular networks;3GPP;Data analysis;Machine learning;Load modeling;Data models","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;data analysis;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","intelligent network data analytics function;5G cellular networks;legacy cellular networks;NWDAF;network operators;machine learning based data analytics methodologies;3GPP specifications;ML models;linear regression;recursive neural networks;network traffic;neural network algorithms;network load prediction;tree-based gradient boosting algorithm;cell-based synthetic data set;3rd generation partnership project standard documents;long-short term memory;logistic regression;anomaly detection","","7","","","","17 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Recently, given their vulnerability to malicious attacks, the security of C-RAN networks has attracted significant attention. Among various anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques, the most promising one is the machine learning-based intrusion detection as it learns without human assistance and adjusts actions accordingly. In this direction, many solutions have been proposed, but they show either low accuracy in terms of attack classification or they offer just a single layer of attack detection. This research focuses on deploying a multi-stage machine learning-based intrusion detection (ML-IDS) in 5G C-RAN that can detect and classify four types of jamming attacks: constant jamming, random jamming, deceptive jamming, and reactive jamming. This deployment enhances security by minimizing the false negatives in C-RAN architectures. The experimental evaluation of the proposed solution is carried out using WSN-DS (Wireless Sensor Networks DataSet), which is a dedicated wireless dataset for intrusion detection.

In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation.

To address these problems, technologies including space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), machine learning, edge computing, and energy harvesting are highly expected in 6G IoT. In this article, we consider the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites to offer wireless-powered IoT devices edge computing and cloud computing services, respectively. To accelerate the communications, Terahertz frequency bands are utilized for communications between UAVs and IoT devices. Since the tasks generated by terrestrial IoT devices can be conducted locally, offloaded to the UAV-based edge servers or remote cloud servers through satellites, we focus on the computation offloading problem and consider deep learning techniques to optimize the task success rate considering the energy dynamics and channel conditions. A deep-learning-based offloading policy optimization strategy is given where the long short-term memory model is considered to address the dynamics of energy harvesting performance.

Static allocation of resources to slices is a straightforward approach to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs), but it may lead to dramatic inefficiencies and high costs. On the other side, dynamic sharing can greatly improve resource utilization, but it requires a strict control of performance parameters so as to guarantee small congestion probability and smoothed degradation when it occurs. In this paper, we propose a utility-based approach that can properly map the slice customization strategies that tenants can use to address the different traffic requirements and their specific service management policies.

Mobile operators shall be able to serve all of these requirements using shared network infrastructure's resources. To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","5G mobile communication;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;quality of service;regression analysis;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics);virtualisation","knapsack problems;admission control;recursive optimization;regression trees;OAI;open air interface;network infrastructure resources;mobile operators;5G network slices;slicing decision;machine learning;static slicing;ML based approaches;5G experimental prototype;slice scheduler modules;resource pool;physical resources;optimum slice;network resources;dynamic slicing approach;physical network;logical virtual networks;shared network infrastructure;heterogeneous demands;resource orchestration;ML based approach;uninformed random slicing-decisions","","6","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). While concluding the paper, it is shown that the LSTM has outperformed the rest of classification techniques with promising results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964697","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951149","Future internet architectures;machine learning;network reliability;privacy;resource management;security;software defined networks;vehicular networks","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security","5G mobile communication;computer network management;computer network reliability;convolutional neural nets;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","software defined networking;vehicular network environments;resource classification;convolutional neural network;deep neural network;5G vehicular network resource management;SDN-based 5G cellular network;vehicular Internet infrastructures;machine learning;radio access network;NFV;network function virtualization;flow-based policy framework;vehicle to vehicle communication;V2V communication;wireless virtualization;LSTM;long short-term memory;CNN;DNN","","9","","28","CCBY","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Amalgamating WiFi networks with 5G/B5G networks has attracted strong researcher interest over the past two decades, because over 70 percent of mobile data traffic is generated by WiFi devices. However, WiFi channel resource scarcity for 5G/B5G is becoming ever more critical. One current problem regarding channel resource allocation is channel collision handling due to increased user densities. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently helped develop prominent behaviorist learning techniques for resource allocation in 5G/B5G networks. An agent optimizes its behavior in an RL-based algorithm based on reward and accumulated value. However, densely deployed WiFi environments are distributed and dynamic, with frequent changes. Thus, relying on individual local estimations leads to higher error variance. Therefore, this article proposes a federated RL-based channel resource allocation framework for 5G/B5G networks, and suggests collaborating learning estimates for faster learning convergence. Experimental results verify that the proposed approach optimizes WiFi performance in terms of throughput by collaborative channel access parameter selection. This study also highlights six potential applications for the proposed framework.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520344","","5G mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless networks;Estimation;Reinforcement learning;Markov processes;Throughput","","","","","","15","","20 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based power control scheme is proposed for improving the system-level EE of two-tier 5G heterogeneous and multi-channel cells. The algorithm aims to maximize the EE of the system by regulating the transmission power of the downlink channels and reconfiguring the user association scheme. To efficiently solve the EE problem, a DQN-based method is established, properly modified to ensure adequate QoS of each user (via defining a demand-driven rewarding system) and near-optimal power adjustment in each transmission link. To directly compare different DQN-based approaches, a centralized (C-DQN), a multi-agent (MA-DQN) and a transfer learning-based (T-DQN) method are deployed to address whether their applicability is beneficial in the 5G HetNets. Results confirmed that DQN-assisted actions could offer enhanced network-wide EE performance, as they balance the trade-off between the power consumption and achieved throughput (in Mbps/Watt). Excessive performance was observed for the MA-DQN approach (>5 Mbps/Watt), since the decentralized learning supports low-dimensional agents to be coordinated with each other through global rewards. In further comparing the T-DQN against MA-DQN solutions, T-DQN presents beneficial usage for very low or very high inter-cell distances, whereas the usage of MA-DQN is preferred (by a factor of ~1.3) for intermediate inter-cell distances (100-600m), where the power savings are feasible towards achieving increased EE. Furthermore, T-DQN scheme guarantees good EE solutions (above 2 Mbps/Watt), even for densely-deployed macro-cells, with effortless training and memory requirements. On the contrary, MA-DQN offers the best EE solutions at the expense of massive training resources and required training time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3113501","Affordable5G Project funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 and 5G-PPP Programs(grant numbers:H2020-ICT-2020-1,957317); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540685","5G network;deep Q-learning;energy efficiency;radio resource management;reinforcement learning;transfer learning","Optimization;5G mobile communication;Training;Mathematical model;Quality of service;Throughput;Energy efficiency","","","","","","35","CCBY","16 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike previous network generations, 5G utilizes complex digital technologies such as massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and runs over higher radio frequencies. The introduction of new technologies and advanced features in the 5G network raises new challenges for network operators, and merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the effective solutions to address these complexities. However, AI-enabled 5G network engenders security concerns and requires improvement to meet the standardization and qualification of the new network generation. To mitigate these dilemmas, Blockchain must be integrated. Blockchain, as a decentralized methodology provides a secure sharing of information and resources among various nodes of 5G environments. Blockchain can support other technologies, such as AI-based 5G, to create smarter, more efficient, and secure cellular networks. In this article, we present a comprehensive intelligence and secure data analytics framework for 5G networks based on the convergence of Blockchain and AI named “Block5GIntell”. We depict the applications of Blockchain and AI on 5G networks separately and we argue on the support that Blockchain can provide for AI to create smart and secure 5G networks relying on our proposed framework. To support our proposition, we present an energy-saving case study using Blockchain for AI-enabled 5G.

Specifically, a subset of the antennas of virtual wireless networks transmits pilot symbols for estimating the CSI and use the estimated CSI dataset to train and estimate the remaining channels and future CSI for virtual networks using machine learning algorithms. This helps not only to predict the CSI with least overhead and fulfills the service demands of users but also to reduce the power consumption and computation overhead in the network. Predicted CSI is leveraged for RF slicing for virtual wireless networks.

Specifically, we formulate a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) based optimization problem to maximize the sum goodput of eMBB users while satisfying URLLC and eMBB users' QoS requirements. The proposed scheme considers the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and the active user's queue status for the dynamic assignment of radio resources to the heterogeneous users according to its demand. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is first transformed into a tractable form by exploiting the probabilistic to non-probabilistic conversion, Big-M theory, and difference-of-convex (DC) programming. Later, the transformed problem is solved using the successive convex approximation (SCA) based iterative algorithm.

The successful realization of the URLLC entails the advent of new technological concepts. Therefore, this article presents an overview of the enabling techniques for the URLLC. Classification of the enabling techniques is done and an extensive review of the literature is presented to identify the state-of-the-art techniques, limitations, and the potential approaches for alleviating the limitations. It is observed that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled edge computing and caching solutions are widely explored as promising techniques to effectively guarantee low latency and reliable content acquisition while reducing redundant network traffic and improving the QoE. Therefore, we present a classification of the AI-enabled edge caching solutions and discuss various mechanisms of the caching agents. In particular, we investigate the use of deep learning (DL), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and federated learning (FL) algorithms. Subsequently, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art edge caching schemes and demonstrate the performance gains of FL frameworks over conventional centralized and decentralized DL and DRL frameworks.

In this article, we present an intelligent mobile edge network based on standardized 5G network function entities and New Radio (NR) radio access networks (RANs). We propose a multitier, self-organizing network (SON) with a middle-tier SON (mSON), centralized SON (cSON), and distributed SON (dSON) to support increasing network dynamicity for different verticals and to take advantage of the latest high-layer F1 interface. This is essential to support low-latency applications and ultrahigh-reliability services. It also enables more dynamically tight interworking of 5G NR and LTE with dual connectivity, expanding initial 5G NR coverage. We analyze a lower-layer RAN split to optimize fronthaul and so further improve radio efficiency by utilizing the multitier SON among various radio nodes as well as distributed units (DUs) and centralized units (CUs).

Even though existing studies have shown how to perform 5G RAN slicing to flexibly provision service according to their initial requirements, a proper dynamic RAN slice adjustment and migration strategy is also required to accommodate the highly dynamic nature of mobile traffic while maintaining lower service blocking. In this paper, we provide a traffic-prediction-based strategy for dynamic 5G RAN slice adjustment and migration in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) metro-aggregation networks, which targets the minimization of (1) the slice degradation penalty, which accounts for both the degradation degree and slice priority, and (2) the migrated traffic during slice migration.

However, the need for a higher level of automation to establish hyper-low latency, and hyper-high reliability for beyond 5G applications requires extensive research on machine learning with applications in wireless communications. Thereby, learning techniques will take a central stage in the sixth generation of wireless communications to cope up with the stringent application requirements. This paper studies the practical limitations of these learning methods in the context of resource management in a non-stationary radio environment. Based on the practical limitations we carefully design and propose supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models to support rate maximization objective under user mobility. We study the effects of practical systems such as latency and reliability on the rate maximization with deep learning models. For common testing in the non-stationary environment, we present a generic dataset generation method to benchmark across different learning models versus traditional optimal resource management solutions. Our results indicate that learning models have practical challenges related to training limiting their applications. These models need an environment-specific design to reach the accuracy of an optimal algorithm.

Accurate fault location is the basis of slice management. In virtualized network model, the function of network elements is software, the underlying layer is highly abstract, the structure changes dynamically, and common cause faults occur frequently, which brings difficulties to fault location. Deep Learning is a machine Learning method that USES Deep Neural Network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers to complete Learning tasks. The essence is that by building a neural network model with multiple hidden layers and using a large amount of training data to learn more useful features, the accuracy of model prediction or classification can be improved. Based on the theory of deep mapping learning algorithm, a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and idle network is designed for centralized wireless network control system. Aiming at the centralized wireless network control system, this paper designs a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and network idleness. The designed sensor network node platform uses the programmable logic controller as the main control chip, contains the data interface module that realizes the communication function between the node and the upper computer, and the acquisition and conditioning module responsible for the collection and conditioning and conversion of the analog signal.

The accuracy of the model is verified, and the interference distribution of the model and the influence of the D2D inter-pair distance on the system performance are simulated.

Proactive algorithms will require accurate forecasting of highly contextualised traffic demand and quantifying the uncertainty to drive decision making with performance guarantees. Context in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) is often challenging to uncover, unfolds over time, and even more difficult to quantify and integrate into decision making. The first part of the review focuses on mining and inferring CPSS context from heterogeneous data sources, such as online user-generated-content.

Considering the bandwidth and resource requirements of different services, such as unicast and multicast services of multimedia TV broadcasting, rationally allocating resources while providing high-quality services and realizing green energy savings of base stations is one of the challenges. This paper is aimed at the resource allocation for TV multimedia service in the 5G wireless cloud network (C-RAN) scenario, which can support unicast services for cellular users and multicast services for broadcast services simultaneously, and it proposes the corresponding slice resources allocation architecture based on the concept of a self-organizing network. The management architecture first builds the functions and processes of the corresponding autonomous resource management. Based on the multidimensional data, an effective deep learning model named LSTM (long short-term memory) is used to construct the dynamic traffic model of the multicast service in space-time, which provides a basis for further network resource allocation. Based on the prediction results and the condition of satisfying the changing requirements of users, the corresponding optimization model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the energy usage of the RRHs (remote radio heads) and taking the QoS constraints of the users into account. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework combined with a convex optimization method are then used to complete the users' bandwidth and power resource allocation. The experimental results show that the proposed method can not only predict the multicast service requirement accurately but also effectively improve the energy efficiency of the network under targeted QoS requirements along with time variations.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2020.2968730","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901054); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8989816","5G broadband TV services;C-RAN;deep learning;energy efficiency;resource allocation;multicast","5G mobile communication;TV;Resource management;Predictive models;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Unicast;Wireless communication","5G mobile communication;broadband networks;cellular radio;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;next generation networks;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","eMBB scenario;important driving forces;resource requirements;multimedia TV broadcasting;high-quality services;realizing green energy savings;base stations;TV multimedia service;cloud network;unicast services;cellular users;broadcast services;corresponding slice resources allocation architecture;management architecture;autonomous resource management;effective deep learning model;long short-term memory;dynamic traffic model;network resource allocation;corresponding optimization model;deep reinforcement learning framework;multicast service requirement;5G broadband TV service;next-generation TV;media services;cross-domain experience","","9","","38","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work aims to find the most efficient combination of the access network and network slices in 5G heterogeneous scenarios to maximize the quality of service (QoS). We propose the Dynamic Access control and Slice Allocation (DASA) algorithm, focused on users' current needs, their priorities, and network conditions.

Considering the dense deployment of small cells and the existence of heterogeneous cells, an MTC device can discover multiple cells for association. Under traditional cell association mechanisms, MTC devices are typically associated with an eNodeB with highest signal strength. However, the selected eNodeB may not be able to handle mMTC requests due to network congestion and overload. Therefore, reliable cell association would provide a smarter solution to facilitate mMTC connections. To enable such a solution, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based machine learning (ML) technique is proposed in this paper to perform optimal cell association. As such, we consider MTC devices with network-assisted decision-making capabilities for selecting the most appropriate eNodeB for data transmission. The proposed HMM based ML technique focuses mainly on the reliability and availability of network resources. Correspondingly, two schemes are developed based on the classical reliability function and the next probable state of the HMM. Based on simulations under various configurations, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed schemes over a random cell selection scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761913","","Hidden Markov models;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Machine learning;5G mobile communication;Reliability;Performance evaluation","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;telecommunication computing","HMM;random cell selection scheme;mMTC device cell association;massive machine-type communication;dense deployment;heterogeneous cells;MTC device;network congestion;mMTC connections;hidden Markov model based machine learning technique;network-assisted decision-making capabilities;eNodeB;signal strength;cell association mechanisms;5G networks","","1","","15","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, 3GPP is devising a new architecture for the core network, which replaces point-to-point interfaces used in 3G and 4G by producer/consumer-based communication among 5G core network functions, facilitating deployment over a virtual infrastructure. One big advantage of using VNFs is the possibility of dynamic scaling, depending on traffic load (i.e., instantiate new resources to VNFs when the traffic load increases and reduce the number of resources when the traffic load decreases). In this article, we propose a novel mechanism to scale 5G core network resources by anticipating traffic load changes through forecasting via ML techniques. The traffic load forecast is achieved by using and training a neural network on a real dataset of traffic arrival in a mobile network.

Since the scheduling policy is a deterministic mapping from channel and queue states to scheduling actions, it can be optimized by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). We show that a straightforward implementation of DDPG converges slowly, has a poor quality-of-service (QoS) performance, and cannot be implemented in real-world 5G systems, which are non-stationary in general. To address these issues, we propose a theoretical DRL framework, where theoretical models from wireless communications are used to formulate a Markov decision process in DRL. To reduce the convergence time and improve the QoS of each user, we design a knowledge-assisted DDPG (K-DDPG) that exploits expert knowledge of the scheduler design problem, such as the knowledge of the QoS, the target scheduling policy, and the importance of each training sample, determined by the approximation error of the value function and the number of packet losses. Furthermore, we develop an architecture for online training and inference, where K-DDPG initializes the scheduler off-line and then fine-tunes the scheduler online to handle the mismatch between off-line simulations and non-stationary real-world systems. Simulation results show that our approach reduces the convergence time of DDPG significantly and achieves better QoS than existing schedulers (reducing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$30\% \sim 50\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> packet losses). Experimental results show that with off-line initialization, our approach achieves better initial QoS than random initialization and the online fine-tuning converges in few minutes.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3078498","Telstra Corporation Ltd., titled “Development of an open programmable scheduler for LTE networks,”; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; two Postgraduate Research Supplementary Scholarships of The University of Sydney; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award(grant numbers:DE150101704); Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship(grant numbers:FL160100032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427224","Deep reinforcement learning;wireless scheduler design;time-sensitive traffic;online implementation","5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Quality of service;Training;Computer architecture;Reinforcement learning;Delays","","","","","","44","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, proliferation in the artificial intelligence (AI)-based sixth-generation (6G) technology for achieving the smart automation system has caught the attention of both academia and industry. Most of the intelligent automation systems are formed by IoT-based user terminal (UT) devices for multimedia (i.e., video, audio, image, and text) content delivery with high clarity and efficiency. Customer satisfaction/perception, i.e., Quality of Experience (QoE), is an essential factor to be analyzed because the Quality of Service (QoS) is not a suitable candidate to portray the feelings and expectations of users during multimedia transmission. Therefore, the energy-efficient, entropy-aware communication, and QoE analysis through IoT devices are the dire need. This article focuses on how the energy-efficient communication and user’s QoE level can be captured through the UT device during multimedia transmission. Thus first, QoS-based joint energy and entropy optimization (QJEEO) algorithm is proposed. Second, the 6G-driven multimedia data structure model and framework are developed for modeling and evaluation of QoE with acquisition time. Third, the relationship between subjective test score (i.e., surveyed data) and objective performance metrics with mobility/speed of IoT-based devices for multimedia service is established. Fourth, the correlation model is proposed for integrating QoS parameters with estimated QoE perceptions. The experimental results indicate that QoE is modeled and evaluated with acquisition time and correlated with QoS parameter, i.e., packet loss ratio (PLR), and average transfer delay during energy-efficient multimedia transmission in 6G-based networks to improve the satisfaction level of customers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024715","CAS President’s International Fellowship Initiative Project China(grant numbers:2020VBC0002); Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur, Pakistan; BNU Startup Research Fund; UIC Startup Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200376","Energy-efficient framework;IoT;sixth generation (6G);smart automation;user terminal (UT) devices","Quality of experience;Automation;Quality of service;Energy efficiency;Multimedia systems;Optimization;Entropy","","","","2","","28","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a scenario, effective end-to-end orchestration of the cognitive functions is vital to reap the full benefits of the available intelligence for automated operation. Existing work in orchestrating cognitive functions has limitations in scope and coverage, and addresses only certain aspects.

However, when such feedback is frequent and the number of UEs in a cell is large, the channel may be overloaded by signaling messages, resulting in lower throughput and data loss. optimizing this signaling process thus represents a key challenge. In this paper, we focus on Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reports that are periodically sent from a UE to the base station, and propose mechanisms to optimize the reporting process with the aim of reducing signaling overhead and avoiding the associated channel overloads, particularly when channel conditions are stable. To this end, we apply machine learning mechanisms to predict channel stability, which can be used to decide if the CQI of a UE is necessary to be reported, and in turn to control the reporting frequency. We study two machine learning models for this purpose, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). Simulation results show that both provide a high prediction accuracy, with NN consistently outperforming SVM in our settings, especially as CQI reporting frequency reduces.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149048","5G;signaling overhead;CQI optimization;machine learning;SVM;NN","Base stations;5G mobile communication;Support vector machines;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Resource management;Machine learning algorithms","4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;radio access networks;radio links;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication signalling;wireless channels","channel quality feedback;5G radio networks;User Equipment connectivity;UE;transmission scheduling;wireless link;signaling messages;signaling process;channel quality indicator reports;base station;signaling overhead;associated channel overloads;channel conditions;machine learning models;high prediction accuracy;CQI reporting frequency;channel stability prediction","","1","","20","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The smart grid concept relies on the integration of high-speed and reliable communication networking technologies in order to provide twofold benefits - one for the interconnection between the existing power grid and intelligent information systems, and another for enabling real-time grid monitoring via IoT devices. However, the security of IoT devices themselves is a challenge due to the trade-off between device cost and secure communication requirements. Further, current electricity grids require robust and secure wireless communication infrastructure to realize transformation to smart grids. The 5G networks are considered as an enabler for digitalization of power grids and facilitating IoT connectivity for future smart grids with several benefits such as low latency, ultra high speed, and improved reliability. However, the use of public 5G networks may introduce new types of security risks to the IoT-based smart grids infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the security aspects of 5G security specifications released by the 3GPP standards organization from the perspective of IoT-based smart grids. In particular, we consider a smart grid scenario utilizing 5G as a wireless communication infrastructure, and present 5G benefits to several security aspects such as authentication, confidentially, integrity, resiliency, and availability.

Among various technologies, communication technologies have enabled to deliver personalized and remote healthcare services. At present, healthcare widely uses the existing 4G network and other communication technologies for smart healthcare applications and are continually evolving to accommodate the needs of future intelligent healthcare applications. As the smart healthcare market expands the number of applications connecting to the network will generate data that will vary in size and formats. This will place complex demands on the network in terms of bandwidth, data rate, and latency, among other factors. As this smart healthcare market matures, the connectivity needs for a large number of devices and machines with sensor-based applications in hospitals will necessitate the need to implement Massive-Machine Type Communication. Further use cases such as remote surgeries and Tactile Internet will spur the need for Ultra Reliability and Low Latency Communications or Critical Machine Type Communication.

In modern power grids, the development of communication networks has enhanced DRM programmes and made the grid smarter. In particular, with progresses in the 5G Internet of Things (IoT), the infrastructure for DRM programmes is improved with fast data transfer, higher reliability, increased security, lower power consumption, and a massive number of connections. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of potential applications of 5G IoT technologies as well as the computational and analytical algorithms applied for DRM programmes in SGs. The review holistically brings together sensing, communication, and computing (optimization, prediction), areas usually studied in a scattered way. A broad discussion on various DRM programmes in different layers of enhanced 5G IoT based SGs is given, paying particular attention to advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms alongside challenges in security, reliability, and other factors that have a role in SGs’ performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082430","School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia; Innovate U.K(grant numbers:105843); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437171","Smart grid;demand response management;5G;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;Load management;Communications technology;Smart grids;Internet of Things;Security;Computer architecture","","","","1","","127","CCBY","20 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traffic loads in different slices are subject to changes over time, resulting in challenges for consistent QoS provisioning. In this paper, a dynamic flow migration problem for embedded services is studied, to meet end-to-end (E2E) delay requirements with time-varying traffic. A multi-objective mixed integer optimization problem is formulated, addressing the trade-off between load balancing and reconfiguration overhead. The problem is transformed to a tractable mixed integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) problem. It is proved that there is no optimality gap between the two problems; hence, we can obtain the optimum of the original problem by solving the MIQCP problem with some post-processing. To reduce time complexity, a heuristic algorithm based on redistribution of hop delay bounds is proposed to find an efficient solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the aforementioned trade-off, the benefit from flow migration in terms of E2E delay guarantee, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristic solution.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2020.2968907","Huawei Technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967040","Service function chaining (SFC);network slicing;dynamic flow migration;end-to-end (E2E) delay;VNF state transfer;SDN/NFV-enabled 5G networks","Delays;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;5G mobile communication;Network function virtualization;Resource management;Software","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;integer programming;linear programming;quadratic programming;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;synchronisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","QoS provisioning;dynamic flow migration problem;embedded services;time-varying traffic;multiobjective mixed integer optimization problem;load balancing;reconfiguration overhead;tractable mixed integer quadratically constrained programming problem;MIQCP problem;time complexity;E2E delay guarantee;network function virtualization;fifth generation communication networks;service-level customized network slices;network infrastructure;statistical resource demands;traffic loads;end-to-end delay requirements;software defined networking;SDN;5G communication networks;quality of service;5G core networks;NFV","","8","","36","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Apart from the tamper-proof exchange of transactions, distributed ledgers can provide a software environment for the trusted execution of smart contracts. In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied. Finally, we propose an architecture for the integration of the secure multi-contract platform into a 5G architecture.

On the basis of this work, this paper designs and implements an alternative solution for Ethernet-based GOOSE communication over a virtualized 5G core network that does not require any modification of the existing network protocol stack and thus is much easier to deploy. Our experimental results show that the delay introduced by the core network is in the order of sub milliseconds, while the one-way delay without a real radio access network, and without background traffic, is less than 1 ms. Moreover, these delays can be significantly reduced with a container-based deployment rather than a virtual machine-based one. Assuming a 1-ms delay budget for a 5G radio access network, our evaluation confirms that it is indeed feasible to use 5G for GOOSE transmission in IEC 61850 substation automation systems.","2573-7562","978-1-7281-1035-6","10.1109/MobileCloud48802.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126750","5G-Core;Virtualization;Low-Latency;Smart-Grid;Container;GOOSE","","5G mobile communication;IEC standards;protocols;radio access networks;smart power grids;substation automation;virtual machines;wireless LAN","IEC 61850 substation automation systems;GOOSE transmission;delay budget;virtual machine-based;container-based deployment;radio access network;sub milliseconds;existing network protocol stack;core network;Ethernet-based GOOSE communication;large-scale smart grid environment;IP-based GOOSE messages;mobile networks;Local Area Network;time-critical information;Generic Object Oriented Substation Event protocol;distantly located substations;real-time communication requirements;time critical communication;virtualized 5G core","","1","","32","","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, ICT brings new potential vulnerabilities within the power grid operation, that need to be evaluated. The strong interdependence between power system and ICT systems requires new methodologies for modeling the smart grid as a Cyber Physical System (CPS), and finally analyzing the impact of ICT failures on the power grid operation. This paper proposes a novel methodological approach that combines Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) modeling and numerical computation for dependability analysis of a 5G-based WAMS. Internal influences such as component failures and external influences such as rain effect are considered, and the impact of these failures are assessed over the WAMS capability to provide reliable data for performing an accurate power network state estimation. Different state estimation approaches (traditional SCADA and PMU-based algorithms) and weather conditions are compared in terms of mean states estimation error and safety.

In this paper, we propose an efficient planning of 5G small cells, with evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast communication, between aggregators (small cells) and SG consumers, for efficient demand-response (DR) programs. After pointing out that optimal multicast scheduling and radio resource management problem is NP-complete, we propose two different solutions, based on dynamic programming (DP) and greedy heuristics, for minimizing the energy cost for DR customers. We also analyze the performance of SG user capacity for 5G single cell multicast and multicast broadcast single frequency network. Extensive OPNET simulation results, over actual energy data and real wireless trace, demonstrate that our proposed 5G small cell planning and multicast solutions are capable of reducing energy production cost by 30%, with up to 35% shift in peak energy load, low latency and packet drop.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2017.2681105","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1D1A1B03935633); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875423","Demand response (DR);dynamic programming (DP);evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast (eMBMS);greedy;5G;multicast broadcast single frequency network (MBSFN);NP-complete;smart grids (SGs);radio resource management (RRM)","5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Wireless communication;Smart grids;Planning;Interference","5G mobile communication;cyber-physical systems;dynamic programming;smart power grids;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication power supplies","5G small cell planning;eMBMS;optimal demand response;smart grids;cyber-physical systems;information technologies;large-scale power supply;large-scale power management;control-feedback loop;multimedia broadcast;multicast communication;demand response program;NP-complete;dynamic programming;DP;greedy heuristics;5G single cell multicast;multicast broadcast single frequency network;real wireless trace","","30","","26","","10 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the virtualization enhancements developed within the H2020 5GCity project to support the neutral host model for smart city deployments. The envisioned virtualization technology demands security and technology extensions with a unified view of sliceable and heterogeneous devices and radio technologies (e.g., LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi). In our solution, security is enhanced by deploying a robust compute node authentication, monitoring, and geo-tagging. In addition, wireless connectivity is extended via an innovative multiple RAN controller approach for the management and control of heterogeneous radio resources.

From the service management and orchestration (MANO) point of view, the proposed fronthaul solution also deploys an advanced software defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) control and orchestration architecture developed with the goal to optimally manage and reconfigure the physical layer resources (i.e., optical and radio) at the central office and cell sites (i.e., pool of baseband units (BBUs), remote radio heads (RRHs), ARoF transceivers and OBFNs). The proposed beyond 5G fronthaul architecture is primarily oriented to deploy massive machine-type communication (mMTC) services with high-bandwidth requirements, such as for industry 4.0. In this paper we experimentally validate the novel OBFN system, and the dynamic SDN/NFV MANO of the transport connectivity and network services for optical beamforming. The obtained experimental results show that the overall delay for the provisioning and removal of an OBF service, considering the contribution of the involved optical and radio systems and the SDN/NFV MANO layer, is 134s and 18s respectively.

In PADA, each power storage unit calculates two secret keys to be shared by the utility company and the gateway to blind power injection bids, then aggregates the blinded bids of different time slots by using a novel aggregation technique called hash-then-homomorphic. The local gateway partially removes the blind factor from the received data by computing the corresponding shared secret key, then further aggregates the masked bids before sending them to the company. The company computes the total amount of collected power at each time slot by removing a blind factor from the aggregated bid and performing a decryption. User privacy is preserved in PADA because adversaries cannot know individual bids. Besides, extensive evaluations indicate that PADA is secure and efficient.","","978-1-5386-0604-9","10.1109/NaNA.2017.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247106","5G;smart grid;power injection;privacy;homomorphic aggregation","Companies;Logic gates;Smart grids;5G mobile communication;Cryptography;Data aggregation","5G mobile communication;cryptography;data privacy;smart power grids;telecommunication security","shared secret key;masked bids;individual bids;user privacy;aggregated bid;time slot;blind factor;local gateway;novel aggregation technique;blind power injection bids;power storage unit;privacy-aware data aggregation scheme;privacy issues;security;smart grid;efficient communication;PADA","","4","","22","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultrareliability low latency communication (uRLLC) are considered as two main scenarios. Different from the eMBB, which requires high data rate, the uRLLC requires extremely high reliability and very low latency. With multiple demands, the coexistence of eMBB and uRLLC will be an urgent challenge for the 5G networking strategy. In this article, a dynamic multiconnectivity (MC)-based joint scheduling framework with traffic steering for eMBB and uRLLC is proposed. The eMBB and uRLLC are specifically sliced with each other, which avoids the queue of uRLLC. A modified effective capacity (EC) model is proposed to measure the performance of our framework, which improves the throughput of eMBB under the guarantee of uRLLC latency. The proposed EC model turns the analytical target to the queue of users, different from the queue of base stations in traditional EC model. By a two-step optimization, the typical mixed integer nonlinear programming conducted by the EC model is decomposed into the integral programming and the nonlinear programming. The system-level simulation results show the proposed framework enhances the system throughput effectively while guaranteeing the uRLLC latency.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2977666","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L172033); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B16006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057462","Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB);effective capacity (EC);fifth-generation (5G);joint scheduling;multiconnectivity (MC);traffic steering (TS);ultrareliability low latency communication (uRLLC)","5G mobile communication;Dynamic scheduling;Long Term Evolution;Resource management;Radio spectrum management;Reliability;Interference","5G mobile communication;integer programming;nonlinear programming;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","uRLLC;eMBB;5G networks;fifth-generation mobile communication system;5G networking strategy;dynamic multiconnectivity-based joint scheduling framework;ultrareliability low latency communication;mixed integer nonlinear programming","","2","","34","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can effectively combine with 5G smart grid to realize flexible deployment and coverage. AODV routing protocol is widely used in AODV network, but because it is based on the shortest path algorithm, with the increase of network load, it will lead to network congestion and performance degradation. In order to solve the above problems, this paper fully considers the impact of link quality and network load on mobile ad hoc networks, and designs a routing protocol RC-AODV based on link congestion handling. The algorithm calculates the load of the node as the measure of the congestion of the node, establishes the backup route in the process of route discovery, and takes the congestion of the node as one of the criteria to establish the route. At the same time, in the process of data packet transmission, by judging the congestion of nodes, avoiding the congestion nodes, reducing the packet loss of the network, to a certain extent, it can alleviate the congestion of the network and improve the performance of the network. Finally, the NS-2 simulation platform is used to analyze the impact of node residence time and maximum mobile speed on the performance of routing protocol. By selecting the change of end-to-end average transmission delay, it shows that this scheme can effectively alleviate network congestion, reduce network delay and improve network performance.","2474-9133","978-1-6654-3944-2","10.1109/ICCCWorkshops52231.2021.9538909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538909","5G;smart grid;Ad hoc;AODV","Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Packet loss;Routing;Routing protocols;Heterogeneous networks;Smart grids","","","","","","13","","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

D-TDD systems are receiving a lot of attention because they can reduce latency and increase spectrum utilization via flexible and dynamic duplex operation in 5G New Radio (NR). However, the advantages of the D-TDD system are difficult to fully utilize due to the cross-link interference (CLI) arising from the use of different transmission directions between adjacent cells. This paper is a survey of the research from academia and the standardization efforts being undertaken to solve this CLI problem and make the D-TDD system a reality. Specifically, we categorize and present the approaches to mitigating CLI according to operational principles. Furthermore, we present the signaling necessary to apply the CLI mitigation schemes. We also present information-theoretic performance analysis of D-TDD systems in various environments. As topics for future works, we discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with the CLI mitigation schemes and signaling design in a variety of environments. This survey is recommended for those who are in the initial stage of studying D-TDD systems and those who wish to develop a more feasible D-TDD system as a baseline for reviewing the research flow and standardization trends surrounding D-TDD systems and to identify areas of focus for future works.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2020.3008765","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2018R1A2A1A05021029); Networks Business Division, Samsung Electronics Company Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139384","Dynamic TDD;cross-link interference;5G;flexible duplex;interference mitigation","5G mobile communication;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Delays;Intercell interference;Throughput;Vehicular ad hoc networks","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication traffic;time division multiplexing","dynamic time division duplex;flexible operation;dynamic duplex operation;CLI mitigation schemes;feasible D-TDD system;dynamic TDD systems;cross-link interference mitigation","","4","","191","IEEE","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
