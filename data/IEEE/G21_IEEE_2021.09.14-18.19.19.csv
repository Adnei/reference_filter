In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computational-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In a wire-wireless network scenario, any mechanism that proposes to manage and allocate resources to implement slicing in wireless devices will require knowledge of the channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a Deep Learning algorithm to predict if a service provider will be able to fulfil a new network slice request given the conditions of the channel and the allocated resources.

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC Discovery Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, existing LTE networks cannot efficiently support stringent but dynamic requirements of V2X services. One effective solution to overcome this challenge is network slicing, whereby different services could be supported by logically separated networks. To mitigate the increasing complexity of network slicing in 5G, we propose to leverage the recent advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies for automated network operation. Specifically, we propose intelligent network slicing architecture for V2X services, where network functions and multi-dimensional network resources are virtualized and assigned to different network slices. In achieving optimized slicing intelligently, several critical techniques, including mobile data collection and the design of an ML algorithm, are discussed to tackle the related challenges. Then, we develop a simulation platform to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent network slicing. With the integration of 5G network slicing and ML technologies, the QoS of V2X services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.1800528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884230","","Cloud computing;Network slicing;Vehicle-to-everything;Intelligent networks;5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Reliability","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;quality of service;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","multidimensional network resources;network functions;intelligent network slicing architecture;automated network operation;logically separated networks;LTE networks;emerging V2X communications;5G wireless networks;widely deployed LTE infrastructures;V2X Services Toward 5G;optimized slicing;different network slices","","13","","16","","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several baselines in terms of throughput and delay with low complexity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2900234","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374189,61620106011,61601097); Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile MCM(grant numbers:20160304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z011); Zhongshan City Project(grant numbers:180809162197874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644035","V-FRAN;Network Slicing;Cross Entropy;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Interference;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","entropy;Internet of Things;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;tree searching;vehicular ad hoc networks","resource allocation;slice scheduling algorithm;collaborative scheduling scheme;road traffic speed;release available IoV resource;heavy traffic load;modern transportation systems;intense information exchange;heterogeneous network traffic;complicated network environment;dynamic vehicle density;fog-radio access network;network slicing;maldistributed network traffic;available fog resources;weak resource utilization;smart slice scheduling scheme;vehicular fog radio access networks;network slices;smart network slicing;vehicular fog-RAN;Internet of Vehicles;Markov decision process;Monte Carlo tree search;metric cross entropy","","22","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each communication request comes with quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward can be measured by the weight (priority) of this request. The accumulated reward over time should be maximized by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds a request generation algorithm through reinforcement learning that decides on how to craft fake requests to maximize the reward of fake requests over time, which in turn minimizes the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is more effective than other benchmark attacks such as generating random fake requests and fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement). Finally, we evaluate how the attack performance depends on system parameters such as the weight and the generation rate of fake requests, and the channel condition. Our results show that the flooding attack poses a major threat for network slicing in terms of starving 5G RAN resources and denying service to real network slicing requests.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473567","U.S. Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473567","","Weight measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Throughput;Quality of experience","","","","","","43","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Legacy models that aim at forecasting traffic demands fail to capture these key economic aspects of network operation. To close this gap, we present DeepCog, a deep neural network architecture inspired by advances in image processing and trained via a dedicated loss function. Unlike traditional traffic volume predictors, DeepCog returns a cost-aware capacity forecast, which can be directly used by operators to take short- and long-term reallocation decisions that maximize their revenues.

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios.

However, effective slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) is very challenging due to the diverse QoS requirements and dynamic conditions in the 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;quality of service;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling","model-based control;transfer learning;radio resource allocation;adaptive control strategy;heterogeneous quality of service;5th generation-beyond networks;next generation NodeB-level slicing;autonomic RAN slicing control;self-learning RAN slicing control;network slice;gNodeB-level;packet scheduling level slicing;network-level slicing;network conditions;slicing control performance;network resources;QoS requirements;radio access network;6G networks;5G networks;service provisioning;intelligent self-sustained RAN slicing framework","","1","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","25","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the diversity of these services, slice deployment and orchestration are essential to guarantee service performance in a cost-effective way. Here, we propose an Artificial Intelligence framework for cross-slice admission and congestion control that simultaneously considers communication, computing, and storage resources to maximize resources utilization and operator revenue. First, we propose a smart feature extraction solution to analyze the characteristics of incoming requests together with the already deployed slices, and then automatically evaluates the request requirements to make appropriate decisions. Second, we design an online algorithm that controls the slice admission based on their priorities, the arrival and departure characteristics, and the available resources. To mitigate system overloading, our framework dynamically adjusts resources allocated to low priority slices, thereby reducing the dropping probability of new slice requests. The proposed algorithm offers outstanding advantages over traditional static approaches by automatically adapting the controller decisions to the system changes. Simulation results show that our framework significantly improves the resource utilization and reduces the slice request dropping probabilities up to 44% as compared to the baseline schemes.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2019.2952882","France-Singapore MERLION 2017-2018, Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906,WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier(grant numbers:1 2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015- NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWTEP003- 041); 5G-MoNArch project(grant numbers:761445); Phase II of the 5th Generation Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) program partially; European Commission within the Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896931","Network slicing;reinforcement learning;admission and congestion control","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Noise measurement;Computer architecture","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network planning","slice request dropping probabilities;online algorithm;arrival characteristics;departure characteristics;5G services;5G networks;cross-slice admission;network slicing;slice deployment;artificial intelligence framework;resource utilization;controller decisions;low priority slices;smart feature extraction solution;operator revenue;storage resources;congestion control","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For networks to be able to satisfy those needs, a flexible, adaptable, and programmable architecture based on network slicing is being proposed. A softwarization and cloudification of the communications networks is required, where network functions (NFs) are being transformed from programs running on dedicated hardware platforms to programs running over a shared pool of computational and communication resources. This architectural framework allows the introduction of resource elasticity as a key means to make an efficient use of the computational resources of 5G systems, but adds challenges related to resource sharing and efficiency. In this article, we propose Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a built-in architectural feature that allows the exploitation of the resource elasticity of a 5G network. Building on the work of the recently formed Experiential Network Intelligence (ENI) industry specification group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to embed an AI engine in the network, we describe a novel taxonomy for learning mechanisms that target exploiting the elasticity of the network as well as three different resource elastic use cases leveraging AI.

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience. To validate our approach, we evaluate the agent under different configurations and in real-world settings and present the results.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3074618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409935","5G and beyond;Service Function Chain;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Multi-access Edge Computing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Management and Orchestration.","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Channel allocation;Servers;Resource management","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This chapter identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal‐level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.","","9781119723912","10.1002/9781119723950.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9536303.pdf&bkn=9536219&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Training data;Sensors","","","","","","","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

In this paper, the structure and the protocols of NWDAF that are defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard documents are first described. Then, cell-based synthetic data set for 5G networks based on the fields defined by the 3GPP specifications is generated. Further, some anomalies are added to this data set (e.g., suddenly increasing traffic in a particular cell), and then these anomalies within each cell, subscriber category, and user equipment are classified. Afterward, three ML models, namely, linear regression, long-short term memory, and recursive neural networks are implemented to study behaviour information estimation (e.g., anomalies in the network traffic) and network load prediction capabilities of NWDAF. For the prediction of network load, three different models are used to minimize the mean absolute error, which is calculated by subtracting the actual generated data from the model prediction value. For the classification of anomalies, two ML models are used to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, namely, logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting. According to the simulation results, neural network algorithms outperform linear regression in network load prediction, whereas the tree-based gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression in anomaly detection. These estimations are expected to increase the performance of the 5G network through NWDAF.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143579","Handover;machine learning;NWDAF;5G networks","5G mobile communication;Cellular networks;3GPP;Data analysis;Machine learning;Load modeling;Data models","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;data analysis;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","intelligent network data analytics function;5G cellular networks;legacy cellular networks;NWDAF;network operators;machine learning based data analytics methodologies;3GPP specifications;ML models;linear regression;recursive neural networks;network traffic;neural network algorithms;network load prediction;tree-based gradient boosting algorithm;cell-based synthetic data set;3rd generation partnership project standard documents;long-short term memory;logistic regression;anomaly detection","","6","","","","17 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

This is essential to support low-latency applications and ultrahigh-reliability services. It also enables more dynamically tight interworking of 5G NR and LTE with dual connectivity, expanding initial 5G NR coverage. We analyze a lower-layer RAN split to optimize fronthaul and so further improve radio efficiency by utilizing the multitier SON among various radio nodes as well as distributed units (DUs) and centralized units (CUs).

To ensure improved quality of experience (QoE) of users, 5G and beyond networks require ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). The successful realization of the URLLC entails the advent of new technological concepts. Therefore, this article presents an overview of the enabling techniques for the URLLC. Classification of the enabling techniques is done and an extensive review of the literature is presented to identify the state-of-the-art techniques, limitations, and the potential approaches for alleviating the limitations. It is observed that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled edge computing and caching solutions are widely explored as promising techniques to effectively guarantee low latency and reliable content acquisition while reducing redundant network traffic and improving the QoE. Therefore, we present a classification of the AI-enabled edge caching solutions and discuss various mechanisms of the caching agents. In particular, we investigate the use of deep learning (DL), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and federated learning (FL) algorithms. Subsequently, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art edge caching schemes and demonstrate the performance gains of FL frameworks over conventional centralized and decentralized DL and DRL frameworks.

It has not only transformed the way of communication but also paved a way for many multi-functional devices and technology. The essence of modern culture is the digital economy, which is also the base for a wireless system of connections. There was a time when wireless networks evolved, from 0G towards 4G along with their architectures and new features. The correlation is contrasting between 4G and 5G with their architectures, coverage, speed quality of service, bandwidth, and latency rates. But later the 5G system architecture conceptualized a full-bodied network, which introduced an architecture that worked intensively while the petulant analysis and consultations are stimulated to bring an advanced evolvement in the wireless community, hence 5G was slowly and gradually deployed all over the world. Meanwhile, the idea of 6G is being looked into and the researchers and engineers are working on its architecture and development, which will make it significantly different from the preceding generations some of which have made a mark and some that have not. This paper presents a complete understanding of variations between 4G and 5G wireless network architectures, the comparisons, and the evolvement through all these years. The analytical and factual results help in advancing an evolved 6G architecture and the change, enhancement, and transformation it will bring in the future of Wireless Cellular Networks.","","978-1-7281-9437-0","10.1109/CITISIA50690.2020.9371846","Charles Sturt University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9371846","4G;5G;6G;Architecture;Wireless;conceptualized;analytical;generations;enhancements;transformation","6G mobile communication;Cellular networks;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Systems architecture;Quality of service;Intelligent systems","4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;cellular radio","wireless technology;wireless communication;digital economy;5G system architecture;network architectures;wireless cellular networks;4G cellular network architecture;5G cellular network architecture;6G cellular network architecture","","","","29","","9 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). While concluding the paper, it is shown that the LSTM has outperformed the rest of classification techniques with promising results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964697","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951149","Future internet architectures;machine learning;network reliability;privacy;resource management;security;software defined networks;vehicular networks","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security","5G mobile communication;computer network management;computer network reliability;convolutional neural nets;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","software defined networking;vehicular network environments;resource classification;convolutional neural network;deep neural network;5G vehicular network resource management;SDN-based 5G cellular network;vehicular Internet infrastructures;machine learning;radio access network;NFV;network function virtualization;flow-based policy framework;vehicle to vehicle communication;V2V communication;wireless virtualization;LSTM;long short-term memory;CNN;DNN","","9","","28","CCBY","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile operators shall be able to serve all of these requirements using shared network infrastructure's resources. To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","5G mobile communication;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;quality of service;regression analysis;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics);virtualisation","knapsack problems;admission control;recursive optimization;regression trees;OAI;open air interface;network infrastructure resources;mobile operators;5G network slices;slicing decision;machine learning;static slicing;ML based approaches;5G experimental prototype;slice scheduler modules;resource pool;physical resources;optimum slice;network resources;dynamic slicing approach;physical network;logical virtual networks;shared network infrastructure;heterogeneous demands;resource orchestration;ML based approach;uninformed random slicing-decisions","","6","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the dense deployment of small cells and the existence of heterogeneous cells, an MTC device can discover multiple cells for association. Under traditional cell association mechanisms, MTC devices are typically associated with an eNodeB with highest signal strength. However, the selected eNodeB may not be able to handle mMTC requests due to network congestion and overload. Therefore, reliable cell association would provide a smarter solution to facilitate mMTC connections. To enable such a solution, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based machine learning (ML) technique is proposed in this paper to perform optimal cell association. As such, we consider MTC devices with network-assisted decision-making capabilities for selecting the most appropriate eNodeB for data transmission. The proposed HMM based ML technique focuses mainly on the reliability and availability of network resources. Correspondingly, two schemes are developed based on the classical reliability function and the next probable state of the HMM. Based on simulations under various configurations, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed schemes over a random cell selection scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761913","","Hidden Markov models;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Machine learning;5G mobile communication;Reliability;Performance evaluation","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;telecommunication computing","HMM;random cell selection scheme;mMTC device cell association;massive machine-type communication;dense deployment;heterogeneous cells;MTC device;network congestion;mMTC connections;hidden Markov model based machine learning technique;network-assisted decision-making capabilities;eNodeB;signal strength;cell association mechanisms;5G networks","","1","","15","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, 3GPP is devising a new architecture for the core network, which replaces point-to-point interfaces used in 3G and 4G by producer/consumer-based communication among 5G core network functions, facilitating deployment over a virtual infrastructure. One big advantage of using VNFs is the possibility of dynamic scaling, depending on traffic load (i.e., instantiate new resources to VNFs when the traffic load increases and reduce the number of resources when the traffic load decreases). In this article, we propose a novel mechanism to scale 5G core network resources by anticipating traffic load changes through forecasting via ML techniques. The traffic load forecast is achieved by using and training a neural network on a real dataset of traffic arrival in a mobile network. Two techniques were used and compared: RNN, more specifically LSTM; and DNN. Simulation results show that the forecast-based scalability mechanism outperforms the threshold-based solutions, in terms of latency to react to traffic change, and delay to have new resources ready to be used by the VNF to react to traffic increase.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2018.1800104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8553653","","5G mobile communication;Scalability;3GPP;Telecommunication traffic;Cloud computing;Networked control systems;Delays;Traffic control;Load management;Software defined networking;Smart devices;Dynamic scheduling","5G mobile communication;forecasting theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;recurrent neural nets;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","functional networking entities;point-to-point interfaces;traffic load changes;traffic load forecast;neural network;traffic arrival;mobile network;forecast-based scalability mechanism;traffic change;traffic forecasting;network connectivity;VNF;5G core network scalability;machine learning approach;IoT;NFV;SDN;3GPP;5G core network functions;5G core network resources","","38","","21","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We envision that 5G NS can emerge as a game changer that accelerates the development of FMC while counterintuitively opening up opportunities for fixed operators and the like in need of higher access network capability by leveraging NS-assisted FMC. In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation.

After pointing out that optimal multicast scheduling and radio resource management problem is NP-complete, we propose two different solutions, based on dynamic programming (DP) and greedy heuristics, for minimizing the energy cost for DR customers.

In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security.

The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied.

Functions of EPS elements can be achieved by the SVeNB, according to the type of function or service and the device that is used to achieve that function or service. The current system, even if these functions and services have been virtualized by the system, it may put them away from the users. Consequently, this causes a delay in completing the establishment of a connection. Since these functions and services can be virtualized and programmed in virtual machines (VMs), we have been simulated the kernel of those functions and services executed by the SVeNB through its VMs. Moreover, The SVeNB position is located close to the users, which helps to reduce the End-to-End delay. Our proposed approach gives the SVeNB the ability to share and contribute in making decisions with the core network (CN) and BaseBand Unit (BBU) pool to initiate a connection, further in making determinations within its vision regarding its users. This procedure leads to a reduction in the load on the BBU pool and the CN, thus lessening the latency, and to increase the data rate that is delivered to the users. That means the SVeNB can regionally decide for all local users that are covered by the SVeNB to connect to each other or the Internet. The MATLAB platform has been used to evaluate the SVeNB performance, with the results demonstrating that it surpasses.

However, the application of the 5G network in ambulance service currently lacks a reliable solution and simulation testing of performance in the existing literature. To achieve this end, the primary aim of this study is to propose a 5G-enabled smart ambulance service and then test the quality of service of the proposed solution in experimental settings.

This paper discusses the usage of virtualzation concepts in 5G technology for protection function/application in distribution grid. A 5G based architecture using an edge computing infrastructure to hosting the control and protection applications is proposed. A stochastic activity network based model is used to analyze and compare the reliability of the proposed 5G based architecture with a functionally identical Ethernet based IEC 61850 architecture. The 5G architecture seems to result in a significant gain in availability provided that redundancy on the radio links is used to compensate the loss due to random fading processes.","","978-1-7281-3848-0","10.1109/ICSGSC.2019.00-19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906585","Smart Grid;5G;Dependability;SAN;Modeling","5G mobile communication;Substations;Smart grids;Computer architecture;Virtualization;IEC Standards","","","","","","27","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The smart grid concept relies on the integration of high-speed and reliable communication networking technologies in order to provide twofold benefits - one for the interconnection between the existing power grid and intelligent information systems, and another for enabling real-time grid monitoring via IoT devices. However, the security of IoT devices themselves is a challenge due to the trade-off between device cost and secure communication requirements. Further, current electricity grids require robust and secure wireless communication infrastructure to realize transformation to smart grids. The 5G networks are considered as an enabler for digitalization of power grids and facilitating IoT connectivity for future smart grids with several benefits such as low latency, ultra high speed, and improved reliability. However, the use of public 5G networks may introduce new types of security risks to the IoT-based smart grids infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the security aspects of 5G security specifications released by the 3GPP standards organization from the perspective of IoT-based smart grids. In particular, we consider a smart grid scenario utilizing 5G as a wireless communication infrastructure, and present 5G benefits to several security aspects such as authentication, confidentially, integrity, resiliency, and availability.

The strong interdependence between power system and ICT systems requires new methodologies for modeling the smart grid as a Cyber Physical System (CPS), and finally analyzing the impact of ICT failures on the power grid operation. This paper proposes a novel methodological approach that combines Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) modeling and numerical computation for dependability analysis of a 5G-based WAMS. Internal influences such as component failures and external influences such as rain effect are considered, and the impact of these failures are assessed over the WAMS capability to provide reliable data for performing an accurate power network state estimation. Different state estimation approaches (traditional SCADA and PMU-based algorithms) and weather conditions are compared in terms of mean states estimation error and safety.

As the smart healthcare market expands the number of applications connecting to the network will generate data that will vary in size and formats. This will place complex demands on the network in terms of bandwidth, data rate, and latency, among other factors. As this smart healthcare market matures, the connectivity needs for a large number of devices and machines with sensor-based applications in hospitals will necessitate the need to implement Massive-Machine Type Communication. Further use cases such as remote surgeries and Tactile Internet will spur the need for Ultra Reliability and Low Latency Communications or Critical Machine Type Communication. The existing communication technologies are unable to fulfill the complex and dynamic need that is put on the communication networks by the diverse smart healthcare applications. Therefore, the emerging 5G network is expected to support smart healthcare applications, which can fulfill most of the requirements such as ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, ultra-high reliability, high density, and high energy efficiency. The future smart healthcare networks are expected to be a combination of the 5G and IoT devices which are expected to increase cellular coverage, network performance and address security-related concerns. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the 5G and IoT enabled smart healthcare, Taxonomy, research trends, challenges, and future research directions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769822","5G;smart healthcare;software-defined network;network function virtualization;the Internet of Things (IoT);device-to-device (D2D);ultra reliability and low latency communications","Medical services;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Biomedical monitoring","4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;security of data;telemedicine","diverse smart healthcare applications;future smart healthcare networks;network performance;smart healthcare network;rapid transformation;traditional hospital;distributed patient-centric approach;healthcare vertical;personalized healthcare services;remote healthcare services;future intelligent healthcare applications;smart healthcare market matures;sensor-based applications;existing communication technologies;communication networks;massive-machine type communication","","25","","71","CCBY","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"On the Use of a Virtualized 5G Core for Time Critical Communication in Smart Grid","V. -G. Nguyen; K. -J. Grinnemo; J. Cheng; J. Taheri; A. Brunstrom",Karlstad University; Karlstad University; Karlstad University; Karlstad University; Karlstad University,"2020 8th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering (MobileCloud)","8 Jul 2020","2020","","","1","8","Protection and automation in a smart grid environment often have stringent real-time communication requirements between devices within a substation, as well as between distantly located substations. The Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol has been proposed to achieve this goal as it allows to transfer time-critical information within a few milliseconds. However, the transmission of GOOSE messages is often limited to a small Local Area Network (LAN). An earlier work has proposed to use the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) as a means to transport IP-based GOOSE messages in a large-scale smart grid environment. On the basis of this work, this paper designs and implements an alternative solution for Ethernet-based GOOSE communication over a virtualized 5G core network that does not require any modification of the existing network protocol stack and thus is much easier to deploy. Our experimental results show that the delay introduced by the core network is in the order of sub milliseconds, while the one-way delay without a real radio access network, and without background traffic, is less than 1 ms. Moreover, these delays can be significantly reduced with a container-based deployment rather than a virtual machine-based one. Assuming a 1-ms delay budget for a 5G radio access network, our evaluation confirms that it is indeed feasible to use 5G for GOOSE transmission in IEC 61850 substation automation systems.","2573-7562","978-1-7281-1035-6","10.1109/MobileCloud48802.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126750","5G-Core;Virtualization;Low-Latency;Smart-Grid;Container;GOOSE","","5G mobile communication;IEC standards;protocols;radio access networks;smart power grids;substation automation;virtual machines;wireless LAN","IEC 61850 substation automation systems;GOOSE transmission;delay budget;virtual machine-based;container-based deployment;radio access network;sub milliseconds;existing network protocol stack;core network;Ethernet-based GOOSE communication;large-scale smart grid environment;IP-based GOOSE messages;mobile networks;Local Area Network;time-critical information;Generic Object Oriented Substation Event protocol;distantly located substations;real-time communication requirements;time critical communication;virtualized 5G core","","1","","32","","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This provides the opportunity for suppliers and customers to better communicate with each other by shifting traditional power grids to smart grids (SGs). In this paper, demand response management (DRM) is investigated as it plays an important role in SGs to prevent blackouts and provide economic and environmental benefits for both end-users and energy providers. In modern power grids, the development of communication networks has enhanced DRM programmes and made the grid smarter. In particular, with progresses in the 5G Internet of Things (IoT), the infrastructure for DRM programmes is improved with fast data transfer, higher reliability, increased security, lower power consumption, and a massive number of connections. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of potential applications of 5G IoT technologies as well as the computational and analytical algorithms applied for DRM programmes in SGs. The review holistically brings together sensing, communication, and computing (optimization, prediction), areas usually studied in a scattered way. A broad discussion on various DRM programmes in different layers of enhanced 5G IoT based SGs is given, paying particular attention to advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms alongside challenges in security, reliability, and other factors that have a role in SGs’ performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082430","School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia; Innovate U.K(grant numbers:105843); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437171","Smart grid;demand response management;5G;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;Load management;Communications technology;Smart grids;Internet of Things;Security;Computer architecture","","","","1","","127","CCBY","20 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, reliable timing information has to be delivered to both cellular and fixed devices with predictable delay to enable synchronous communications. This paper studies limitations of utilizing the current transport in mobile networks for smart grid and industrial communications.

In fact, the primary deployments will target nonstandalone models where the gNB (the 5G base station) will interface into the network using the 4G evolved-packet core. Clearly, the 5G-core (5GC) network is still far from being deployed because of a lag in developing the necessary features to support network slicing for various services.
