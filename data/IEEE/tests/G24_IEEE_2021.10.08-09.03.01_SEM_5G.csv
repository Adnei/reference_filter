In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Particularly, in wireless networks, link bitrate depends on several factors (e.g., interference). In a wire-wireless network scenario, any mechanism that proposes to manage and allocate resources to implement slicing in wireless devices will require knowledge of the channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a Deep Learning algorithm to predict if a service provider will be able to fulfil a new network slice request given the conditions of the channel and the allocated resources. As part of the Deep Learning algorithm architecture, given the sequentially of the transmission data, we designed and implemented a Long Short Memory Term network for predicting the channel conditions in the near future.

However, achieving effective network slicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges, particularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the fast-changing network topology. By leveraging the widely deployed LTE infrastructures, we propose a semi-decentralized network slicing framework in this paper based on the C-V2X Mode-4 standard to provide customized network slices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial information of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying network situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each slice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB, each vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is realized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is a convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared to the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior knowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks.

Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents.

In this paper, we present a new dynamic edge/fog network slicing scheme (EFNS) in which tenants can temporarily lease back to the Infrastructure Provider (InP) unused resources to serve demands exceeding its current resources in stock. To efficiently use the resources, tenants can also lease their subscribers' terminals when idle to act as fog nodes augmenting the infrastructure and service capability of the InP. Our goal is to find an optimal slice request admission policy, which includes slices with augmented resources, to maximize the long-term revenue of the InP. A semi-Markov decision process is used to model the arrival of slice requests by taking into account the dynamics of users' demands and availability of resources. To find the optimal policy under uncertain resource demands, a Q-learning (Q-EFNS) algorithm is developed. Additionally, to improve the convergence time and reduce the computational complexity of Q-learning in large-scale scenarios, a Deep reinforcement learning (DQ-EFNS) algorithm and an enhancement based on a Deep Dueling (Dueling DQ-EFNS) algorithm are presented. Finally, simulation results show improvements in the range between 20% to 60% by our algorithms compared to conventional fixed network slicing when only 8% of the subscribers act as fog nodes.

In particular, at a given time slot, the system makes online decisions on the request admission and scheduling, UAV dispatching, and resource slicing for different services. To characterize the impact of those parameters, we construct a time-averaged queue stability criteria by taking queue backlogs of all services into consideration, and formulate a system revenue function which incorporates the time-averaged system throughput and UAV dispatching cost. The objective is to maximize the system revenue while stabilizing the time-averaged queue, which falls into the scope of Lyapunov optimization theory. By bounding the drift-plus-penalty, the original problem can be decoupled into four independent subproblems, each of which is readily solved. The merits of our control framework are three-fold: 1) the system is able to admit and process as many requests as possible (i.e., maximizing the time-averaged throughput); 2) the time-averaged UAV dispatching cost is minimized; and 3) service queues are stabilized in the long-term. Extensive simulations are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the control framework can effectively achieve the system revenue maximization and queueing stabilization. Moreover, it can balance the trade-off among system throughput, UAV dispatching cost, and queueing states via parameter tuning. Compared with the fixed slicing, our dynamic slicing can react to the vehicular environment rapidly and achieve an average 26% of throughput improvement.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3070542","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002389,62001180,62072472,U19A2067); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706403); Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ2050); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18059); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Young Talents Plan of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2019RS2001); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council NSERC of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405488","Space-air-ground integrated vehicular network;dynamic slicing;isolated service provisioning.","Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Throughput;Dispatching;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Satellites;Network slicing","","","","1","","","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In order to ensure the quality of service and build low-cost network infrastructure services, it is a challenging problem to find an appropriate resource allocation mechanism. In this paper, we discuss resource allocation in 5G radio access network (RAN). Considering the real-time resource request of the slice user, we propose a semi-Markov decision system model, which enables the virtual network provider to effectively satisfy the different user demands in real time. Then, we propose a resource slicing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RS-DRL), which aims to improve the long-term benefits of virtual network providers and the utilization of slicing resources. We evaluate the performance of the RS-DRL through evaluations and comparisons.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource reservation and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous virtual resource slicing framework for the next generation radio access network. The infrastructure provider periodically reserves the unused resource to the virtual networks based on their ratio of minimum resource requirements. Then, the virtual networks autonomously control their resource amount using deep reinforcement learning based on the average quality of service utility and resource utilization of users.

A critical issue for network slicing is to determine the amount of resources for a network slice to ensure the quality-of-service requirement, and as such we need to determine the relationship among traffic demand, amount of resources, and end-to-end delay. This problem is non-trivial in a dynamic, virtualized environment. In this paper, we first use stochastic network calculus (SNC) to study the end-to-end delay bound with given traffic demand and resources. Then, we propose a solution to find the amount of resources that should be allocated with given traffic distribution and end-to-end delay bound. Beyond that, we investigate the range of traffic demands that a network slice can support and design a learning-based dynamic network slice resizing strategy, which can significantly reduce overall resizing cost with quality-of-service guarantee.

In this paper, we propose AZTEC, a data-driven framework that effectively allocates capacity to individual slices by adopting an original multi-timescale forecasting model. Hinging on a combination of Deep Learning architectures and a traditional optimization algorithm, AZTEC anticipates resource assignments that minimize the comprehensive management costs induced by resource overprovisioning, instantiation and reconfiguration, as well as by denied traffic demands.

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under dynamic traffic load, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by numerous variables. In this article, we investigate the reconfiguration within a core network slice with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This problem is also intractable by using conventional Deep Q Network (DQN), as it has a multi-dimensional discrete action space which is difficult to explore efficiently. To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose to exploit Branching Dueling Q-network which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. Based on the discrete BDQ network, we develop an intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm (INSRA). Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of INSRA and the numerical results reveal that INSRA can minimize the long-term resource consumption and achieve high resource efficiency compared with several benchmark algorithms.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3019248","Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871099,61631004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177109","Network slice reconfiguration;deep reinforcement learning;core network slicing;branch dueling q-network","Network slicing;Uncertainty;Resource management;Optimization;Machine learning;Substrates;Numerical models","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;connectivity services;performance isolation;network resource utilization;dynamic traffic load;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;high computational complexity;long-term resource consumption;deep Q network;multidimensional discrete action space;discrete BDQ network;intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm;high resource efficiency;branching dueling Q-network;action branching architecture;INSRA","","5","","44","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work provides an optimal and fast resource slicing solution under such dynamics by leveraging the latest advances in deep learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel system model which allows the network provider to effectively allocate its combinatorial resources, i.e., spectrum, computing, and storage, to various classes of users. To allocate resources to users while taking into account the dynamic demands of users and resources constraints of the network provider, we employ a semi-Markov decision process framework. To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy for the network provider without requiring environment parameters, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is adopted. Although this algorithm can maximize the revenue of the network provider, its convergence to the optimal policy is particularly slow, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach using an advanced deep Q-learning technique, called deep dueling that can achieve the optimal policy at few thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can improve the long-term average return of the network provider up to 40% compared with other current approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761907","","Network slicing;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;resource allocation","real-time network slicing;resource slicing solution;semiMarkov decision process framework;uncertain demand;time network slicing;advanced deep Q-learning technique;optimal policy;optimal resource allocation policy;combinatorial resources;uncertain customer demands;network resources;real-time dynamics;deep learning approach","","2","","18","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under traffic uncertainty, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by the numerous variables. In this paper, we investigate network slice reconfiguration with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address the curse of dimensionality of the problem, we propose to incorporate the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) into DRL, to avoid some unnecessary calculations of Q-value by separating the Q-network into a shared value branch and a number of distributed advantage branches. Furthermore, the value branch and the advantage branch of each dimension are aggregated to derive the corresponding dimension's sub-Q-value. Then the best reconfiguration action is composed of the subactions in individual dimensions which are selected by €-greedy policy. Finally, we design an intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy based on BDQ and extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed slice reconfiguration policy.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148848","","Resource management;Substrates;Bandwidth;Numerical models;Machine learning;Quality of service;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;branching dueling q-network;connectivity services;diverse usage scenarios;network slicing;dynamic network slice reconfiguration;intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy;reconfiguration action;advantage branch;distributed advantage branches;shared value branch;DRL;long-term resource consumption;extremely high computational complexity;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;network resource utilization","","1","","13","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This algorithm jointly considers the radio access network slices and core network slices to dynamically allocate resources to maximize the number of access users.

We propose to use DQN algorithm to solve this problem, which can perceive changes in the environment and make dynamic decisions. Under each decision, we need to calculate the reward value of DQN, so we divide the problem into the core side and the access side. Then the dynamic knapsack algorithm and the link mapping algorithm are used to obtain the reward. The simulation results show that the average access rate of DQN scheme is higher than 97%.

Each node relies on harvested energy from the surrounding environment to provide computational services to local users. We propose the concept of dynamic network slicing, in which a regional orchestrator coordinates workload distribution among local fog nodes, providing partitions/slices of energy and computational resources to support a specific type of service with certain quality-of-service guarantees. The resources allocated to each slice can be dynamically adjusted according to service demands and energy availability. A stochastic overlapping coalition-formation game is developed to investigate the distributed cooperation and joint network slicing between fog nodes under randomly fluctuating energy harvesting and workload arrival processes. We observe that the overall processing capacity of the fog computing network can be improved by allowing fog nodes to maintain a belief function about the unknown state and the private information of other nodes. An algorithm based on a belief-state partially observable Markov decision process is proposed to achieve the optimal resource slicing structure among all fog nodes. We describe how to implement our proposed dynamic network slicing within the 3GPP network sharing architecture and evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the real base station (BS) location data of a real cellular system with over 200 BSs deployed in the city of Dublin. Our numerical results show that our framework can significantly improve the workload processing capability of fog computing networks.

Future access points (APs) are expected to have self-organizational capabilities, able to deal with large configuration spaces in order to dynamically configure each slice. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge. Enhanced with an off-line learning step, the proposed approach is able to achieve the optimal slice configuration with a fast convergence, which is attractive for dynamic scenarios.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","10.1109/INFCOMW.2019.8845211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845211","network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;Wi-Fi networks","Wireless fidelity;Network slicing;Artificial neural networks;Optimization;Convergence;Reinforcement learning;Knowledge engineering","learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;wireless LAN","dynamic network slicing;IEEE 802.11 networks;multiple logical networks;unplanned Wi-Fi networks;off-line learning step;deep reinforcement learning;wireless networks;fast-learning DRL model","","6","","20","","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for network slicing in MEC systems, including slice request admission and a revenue model, to investigate the operator's revenue escalation problem while considering traffic variations. The revenue model is mainly composed of the longer-term revenue and short-term revenue. Particularly, we jointly optimize slice request admission in the long-term and resource allocation in the short-term to maximize the operator's average revenue. By employing the Lyapunov optimization technique, we develop an algorithm without requiring any prior-knowledge of traffic distributions, referred to as the DNSRA, to solve the problem. To reduce the computational complexity of directly solving the DNSRA, we decouple the optimization variables for efficient algorithm design. By this, the strategies for user association and CPU-cycle frequency are obtained in closed forms, respectively. Power allocation and subcarriers assignment are obtained by employing the successive convex approximation approach. Meanwhile, we develop a heuristic algorithm to obtain the dynamic slice request admission decision. Simulation results show that the proposed DNSRA can strike a flexible balance between the average revenue and the average delay, and can significantly increase the operator's revenue against existing schemes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2992607","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFE0126000); Key Program of NSFC-Tongyong Union Foundation(grant numbers:U1636209); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902292); Key Research and Development Programs of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY13-07,2019ZDLGY13-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901367); Beijing Wuzi University Youth Research Fund Project(grant numbers:2017XJQN07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087909","Mobile edge computing (MEC);network slicing;traffic variations;operator's revenue;resource allocation","Resource management;Mobile handsets;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization","approximation theory;computational complexity;convex programming;distributed processing;mobile computing;power aware computing;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","dynamic network slicing;resource allocation;mobile edge computing systems;resource slicing;power allocation;mobile devices;MEC systems;heuristic algorithm;slice request admission;energy scheduling;successive convex approximation;CPU-cycle frequency;dynamic slice request admission decision;computational complexity;DNSRA;Lyapunov optimization technique;longer-term revenue;revenue model","","10","","32","IEEE","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automatic control is applied using deep reinforcement learning that can learn optimal control by repeating trial and error. In this paper, we propose a method to allocate radio resources that satisfy the service requirements regardless of the number of slices using deep reinforcement learning. The proposed method flexibly controls multiple slices by observing the state of one slice and calling a model that controls one slice multiple times.

Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case.

This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","1","","34","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Internet of Things (IoT) services in various fields require different types of network service features, such as mobility, security, bandwidth, latency, reliability and control strategies. In order to solve the complex requirements and provide customized services, a new network architecture is needed. To change the traditional control mode used in the traditional network architecture, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is proposed. First, SDN divides the network into the Control Plane and Data Plane and then delegates the network management authority to the controller of the control layer. This allows centralized control of connections of a large number of devices. Second, SDN can help realizing the network slicing in the aspect of network layer. With the network slicing technology proposed by 5G, it can cut the 5G network out of multiple virtual networks and each virtual network is to support the needs of diverse users. In this work, we design and develop a network slicing framework. The contributions of this article are two folds. First, through SDN technology, we develop to provide the corresponding end-to-end (E2E) network slicing for IoT applications with different requirements. Second, we develop a dynamic network slice resource scheduling and management method based on SDN to meet the services' requirements with time-varying characteristics.

Available communication resources (frequency-time blocks and transmit powers) and computational resources (processor usage) are allocated to stochastic arrivals of network slice requests. Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput, computational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible, it is served with available communication and computational resources allocated over its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some of the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that can optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for network slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the network utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing requests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational constraints. Results show that reinforcement learning provides major improvements in the 5G network utility relative to myopic, random, and first come first served solutions. While reinforcement learning sustains scalable performance as the number of served users increases, it can also be effectively used to assign resources to network slices when 5G needs to share the spectrum with incumbent users that may dynamically occupy some of the frequency-time blocks.","2378-4873","978-1-7281-6339-0","10.1109/CAMAD50429.2020.9209299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209299","5G security;network slicing;radio access network;network optimization;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Resource management;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Optimization;Throughput;Bit error rate","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","frequency-time blocks;reinforcement learning;dynamic resource optimization;5G radio access network slicing;dynamic resource allocation;network slice requests;Q-learning solution;computational constraints","","2","","22","","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By leveraging SDN and NVF techniques, it enables the coexistence of several heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs) on top of the same physical infrastructure. Despite the advantages it brings to network operators, network slicing raises a major challenge: Resource allocation of VNs, also known as the virtual network embedding problem (VNEP). VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics.

Slicing divides a physical network into multiple dedicated logical networks to meet the requirements of diverse use cases. Efficient slice deployment algorithms are critical in reducing network operators' costs and energy consumption and in providing users better service. Many researchers have focused on static deployment when investigating network slices, effectively ignoring network operators' requirements for the dynamic deployment and expansion of such slices. In this paper, we first construct a joint optimization problem of cost and energy consumption. Then, we propose a prediction-assisted adaptive network slice expansion algorithm to deploy network slices dynamically. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts. First, we devise a Holt-Winters (HW) prediction algorithm to determine traffic demand for network slices. This method is intended to avoid frequent changes in network topology. Second, we propose a virtual network function (VNF) adaptive scaling strategy to reasonably determine the number of VNFs and resources required for network slices to avoid resource wastage. Finally, we develop a proactive online algorithm to deploy network slices. This method deploys network slices reasonably via the VNF deployment algorithm and link-routing algorithm to ensure slices' service requirements. Resource capacity and delay requirements are also considered in our evaluation to ensure that network costs and energy consumption are minimized. We then perform a series of simulation experiments to compare the proposed method's performance to state-of-the-art dynamic network slicing technologies. Ultimately, our solution is deemed a suitable candidate for dynamic deployment of 5G network slices; the solution demonstrates advantages of high resource utilization, low deployment costs, and low energy consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010623","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901043,61872044); research project 2020KYNH104 of Beijing Information Science and Technology University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144576","Adaptive scaling;dynamic deployment;energy consumption;link routing;network slice;virtual network function","Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Energy consumption;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Delays;Adaptive systems","5G mobile communication;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","fifth-generation mobile networks;multiple dedicated logical networks;efficient slice deployment algorithms;network operators;prediction-assisted adaptive network slice expansion algorithm;dynamic network slicing technologies;dynamic network slice scaling;Holt-Winters prediction algorithm","","1","","37","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technical integration in Fi-Wi networks provides users with the possibility to establish high-quality connections that guarantee flexibility and economy. However, there are heterogeneous structures and resource types between the subnets of the Fi-Wi network. This article considers the segmented application of network slicing technology in the optical backbone and hybrid access parts of Fi-Wi networks. In this way, the seamless connection of wired and wireless networks can be realized, and meanwhile adapt to the multiple network service forms and differentiated service quality requirements introduced in the 5G network era. In this article, we design a dynamic slicing (PDSM) scheme based on traffic prediction. This scheme includes all four procedures of service provisioning, which are network slice creation, traffic prediction, online reconfiguration of network slices and intra-slice routing, and resource allocation based on the prediction results. It is more flexible than the traditional static slicing scheme in the scenario, where the network state changes dynamically. We develop a prediction-based dynamic slicing algorithm (PD-MSRA) with intra-slice multi-path routing and shared resource allocation for the entire workflow of PDSM. We evaluate the performance of PD-MSRA on a variety of network topologies, and also implement several comparison algorithms including static slicing strategies.

One effective solution to overcome this challenge is network slicing, whereby different services could be supported by logically separated networks. To mitigate the increasing complexity of network slicing in 5G, we propose to leverage the recent advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies for automated network operation. Specifically, we propose intelligent network slicing architecture for V2X services, where network functions and multi-dimensional network resources are virtualized and assigned to different network slices. In achieving optimized slicing intelligently, several critical techniques, including mobile data collection and the design of an ML algorithm, are discussed to tackle the related challenges.

This paper models the handoff problem of end-to-end NS as a Markov decision process (MDP) maximizing the utility related to the UE's profit of being served, the handoff cost and the outage penalty. Both the states of the radio access network resources and the core network resources of each end-to-end NS are considered.

This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and intercell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm.

However, effective slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) is very challenging due to the diverse QoS requirements and dynamic conditions in the 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;quality of service;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication scheduling","model-based control;transfer learning;radio resource allocation;adaptive control strategy;heterogeneous quality of service;5th generation-beyond networks;next generation NodeB-level slicing;autonomic RAN slicing control;self-learning RAN slicing control;network slice;gNodeB-level;packet scheduling level slicing;network-level slicing;network conditions;slicing control performance;network resources;QoS requirements;radio access network;6G networks;5G networks;service provisioning;intelligent self-sustained RAN slicing framework","","1","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing method that flexibly allocates RAN resources using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In RANs, the number of slices controlled by a base station fluctuates in terms of user ingress and egress from the base station coverage area and service switching on the respective sets of user equipment. Therefore, when resource allocation depends on the number of slices, resources cannot be allocated when the number of slices changes. We consider a method that makes optimal-resource allocation independent of the number of slices. Resource allocation is optimized using DRL, which learns the best action for a state through trial and error. To achieve independence from the number of slices, we show a design for a model that manages resources on a one-slice-by-one-agent basis using Ape-X, which is a DRL method. In Ape-X, because agents can be employed in parallel, models that learn various environments can be generated through trial and error of multiple environments. In addition, we design a model that satisfies the slicing requirements without over-allocating resources. Based on this design, it is possible to optimally allocate resources independently of the number of slices by changing the number of agents. In the evaluation, we test multiple scenarios and show that the mean satisfaction of the slice requirements is approximately 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986050","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057705","Deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;RAN slicing;resource management","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Machine learning;Scalability;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication switching","flexible resource block allocation;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing method;RAN resources;optimal-resource allocation;one-slice-by-one-agent basis;fifth-generation mobile communications;RAN slicing method;Ape-X","","7","","34","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several baselines in terms of throughput and delay with low complexity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2900234","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374189,61620106011,61601097); Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile MCM(grant numbers:20160304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z011); Zhongshan City Project(grant numbers:180809162197874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644035","V-FRAN;Network Slicing;Cross Entropy;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Interference;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","entropy;Internet of Things;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;tree searching;vehicular ad hoc networks","resource allocation;slice scheduling algorithm;collaborative scheduling scheme;road traffic speed;release available IoV resource;heavy traffic load;modern transportation systems;intense information exchange;heterogeneous network traffic;complicated network environment;dynamic vehicle density;fog-radio access network;network slicing;maldistributed network traffic;available fog resources;weak resource utilization;smart slice scheduling scheme;vehicular fog radio access networks;network slices;smart network slicing;vehicular fog-RAN;Internet of Vehicles;Markov decision process;Monte Carlo tree search;metric cross entropy","","22","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This allows the network to support the diverse requirements of different IoT verticals ranging from connected vehicles to smart agriculture. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network slice assignment scheme for software-defined IoT networks, where each application type is assigned to a distinct slice controller depending on its QoS requirements. We formulate the optimal mapping between network slices and slice controllers as an integer programming problem, and show that the proposed scheme is capable of significantly reducing the number of QoS violations compared to existing controller mapping schemes. Further, we present a scheduling scheme to dynamically re-compute the optimal mapping, based on optimal stopping theory, while taking into consideration the temporal variations in traffic and link latencies.

Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture that incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the mobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a scalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS to autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice orchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken by the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and reactive resource provisioning techniques. The proposed resource dimensioning heuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which consists of an open network of G/G/m queues.

In order to cope with those requirements, network infrastructure needs to evolve from a static and closed architecture towards a more scalable, dynamic and agile one. SDN and NFV allows to provide different services, each one with its own QoS constraints, independent and secure, thanks to the network slicing concept, the main subject of this work.

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computationally-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (5GAuRA)(grant numbers:675806); Secretaria d’Universitats i Recerca del Departament d’Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2017 SGR 376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","19","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are two of the key enabler technologies in 5G networks that can be used to optimize the allocation of the network resources and guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications. As traditional model-based optimization techniques generally end up with NP-hard and strongly non-convex and nonlinear mathematical programming formulations, in this article, we introduce a model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the resource allocation problem in MEC-enabled IoV networks based on network slicing. Furthermore, the solution uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable better exploitation of the scarce channel resources. The considered problem addresses jointly the channel and power allocation, the slice selection, and the vehicle selection (vehicle grouping).

Network slicing has been envisaged as an efficient technology to meet these diverse demands. In this paper, we propose a dynamic virtual resources allocation scheme based on the radio access network (RAN) slicing for uplink communications to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS). To maximum the weighted-sum transmission rate performance under delay constraint, formulate a joint optimization problem of subchannel allocation and power control as an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. Based on the equivalent Bellman equation, the optimal control policy is first derived by the value iteration algorithm. However, the optimal policy suffers from the widely known curse-of-dimensionality problem.

Furthermore, the Q-factor and Lagrangian multipliers are updated by the use of an online stochastic learning algorithm.

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed service deployment algorithm achieves 100% in terms of both overall resource utilization and admission for higher priority slices in some scenarios in bandwidth-constrained contexts, which cannot be achieved by other existing schemes due to priority constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044951","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-108713RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294018","5G;network slicing;network services;quality of service;virtual network function;SKM","Quality of service;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Network slicing;Network topology;Routing","5G mobile communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","quality of service;QoS;network function virtualization technology;end-to-end network slices;intelligent resource allocation algorithms;network resources;NFV architecture;resource allocation strategy;resource utilization optimization;service deployment algorithm;priority slices;NFV aware network service;squatting-kicking model;5G mobile communication;SKM;intelligent Network slicing","","","","46","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Q-th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds. These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. Numerical results on various slice-level resources show that SFL enables SLA enforcement while significantly reducing the overhead compared to both state-of-the-art FedAvg and centralized constrained deep learning schemes.

In this paper, we investigate the realization approach of fog RAN slicing, where two network slice instances for hotspot and vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios are concerned and orchestrated. In particular, the framework for RAN slicing is formulated as an optimization problem of jointly tackling content caching and mode selection, in which the time-varying channel and unknown content popularity distribution are characterized. Due to the different users' demands and the limited resources, the complexity of original optimization problem is significant high, which makes traditional optimization approaches hard to be directly applied. To deal with this dilemma, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, whose core idea is that the cloud server makes proper decisions on the content caching and mode selection to maximize the reward performance under the dynamical channel state and cache status. The simulation results demonstrate the performance in terms of hit ratio and sum transmit rate can be significantly improved by the proposal.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.2965927","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003,61925101,61831002,61901044); State Major Science and Technology Special Project(grant numbers:2018ZX03001025,2018ZX033001023); 03 Special Project and 5G Program of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20192ABC03A041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:JQ18016); National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962338","Fog radio access network;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Computer architecture;Resource management;Radio access networks;Optimization","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;time-varying channels;wireless channels","vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios;5G;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;optimization problem;content popularity distribution;content caching;network slice;radio access network slicing;core network;fog-RAN slicing","","10","","44","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to be independently managed by different players (tenants), slices need to be logically isolated from each other. As some of the applications envisioned for 5G networks are quite critical from performance point of view, a static slicing of resources, where isolation is not only logical but also physical, may appear a natural solution. However, the price to pay in terms of resource overprovisioning can be high, and therefore dynamic allocation strategies, based on optimized resource sharing, are alternative solutions. In this work, we propose an optimization framework to compare the two resource allocation schemes and define a metric to quantify the slicing gain.

The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP.

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","27","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though the architectural framework and the elements of abstraction and orchestration mechanisms have been defined, the dynamic orchestration of resources based on them entails the adoption of existing sophisticated control techniques, or the design of new ones for the specific environment. In the present paper, we address the problem of load balancing among multiple network service chains (which represent network slice instantiations of a Network Service Provider referring to a specific vertical application) originating from different Points of Presence (PoPs). For scalability reasons, we want to maintain the problem within an informationally decentralized setting, where each PoP has the knowledge of the aggregate workload generated by the slice users accessing through it, but not of that of the other PoPs (to avoid the exchange of information for control purposes). By taking also into account power consumption policies of the Infrastructure Provider, we find a set of candidate team-optimal solutions to this load-balancing problem, which are characterized by piecewise-linear functions, and compare their performance with that of other resource allocation strategies.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644472","Network Functions Virtualization;Network Slices;Load Balancing;Network Energy Efficiency;Team Decision Theory","5G mobile communication;Load management;Energy consumption;Servers;Resource management;Cloud computing;Containers","computer network reliability;resource allocation;virtualisation","virtualized environment;orchestration mechanisms;multiple network service chains;PoP;network service provider;virtual network slice instantiations;dynamic network slice instantiations;5G networks;dynamic resource orchestration;points of presence;power consumption;piecewise-linear functions;resource allocation strategies;decentralized scalable dynamic load balancing problem","","1","","21","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party.

Network slicing is advocated by the research community to simultaneously support multiple services on a common physical infrastructure. Federated network slicing, which involves multiple operators, further generalizes the concept to cover a broader range. Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture for multiple operators and cloud providers, with a new proof of business consensus protocol to ensure incentive and fairness. To further enhance its efficiency, we utilize reinforcement learning to accelerate optimizations in the resource allocation. Benefits of the Ai accelerated optimizer are demonstrated in simulations.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.021.1900653","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277900","","Smart contracts;Business;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Consensus protocol;Artificial intelligence;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;cryptography;distributed databases;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;program slicing;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","5G networks;AI accelerated optimization;federated network slicing;artificial intelligence;reinforcement learning;optimization algorithms;decentralized federated slicing architecture;blockchain-enabled architecture;resource allocation;cloud providers","","2","","15","","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic- aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low- priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloud-based radio access networks (CRANs).","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254593","","DNA;Resource management;Games;Delays;Radio access networks;Cloud computing","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","5G;DNS system;traffic- aware resource allocation framework;FRAN;radio access network;tactile internet;flexible radio access","","8","","19","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, PN resource utilization can be improved by introducing advanced orchestration functionalities that can intelligently assign and redistribute resources among the slices of different tenants according to the temporal variation of the VN resource requirements. This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues. The benefits of dynamic slicing come at a cost in terms of service degradation (i.e., when not all the resources required by a VN can be provided), but the paper shows that the service degradation level introduced by the proposed solutions is very small.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000A77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273270","5G transport;Dynamic slicing;IP over WDM;Multi-tenant networks;Network virtualization;Software defined networking","Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Optical fibers","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;software defined networking","dynamic slicing approach;multitenant 5G transport networks;physical network resource utilization;orchestration functionality;software defined networking;network slicing;virtual networks;mixed integer linear programming formulations;heuristic algorithms","","28","","","","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, since extremely big data accesses among fast driving vehicles of unreliable V2X communications through both 5G contention-based random access interfaces: PC5 and sidelink V2X obviously increase contention collision probability, this clearly degrades the performance of delay, loss, and goodput. This paper thus proposes the approach of Dynamically Keeping reserved resource probability with flow traffic Steering (namely DKS) for platooning CACC and Emergency types of slicing in 5G.

The different slices' tenants (i.e. logical operators) are dynamically allocated isolated portions of physical resource blocks (PRBs), baseband processing resources, backhaul capacity as well as data forwarding elements (DFE) and SDN controller connections. By invoking massive key performance indicators (KPIs) datasets stemming from a live cellular network endowed with traffic probes, we first introduce a low-complexity slices' traffics predictor based on a soft gated recurrent unit (GRU). We then build-at each virtual network function-joint multi-slice deep neural networks (DNNs) and train them to estimate the required resources based on the traffic per slice, while not violating two service level agreement (SLA), namely, violation rate-based SLA and resource bounds-based SLA. This is achieved by integrating dataset-dependent generalized non-convex constraints into the DNN offline optimization tasks that are solved via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. In this respect, we highlight the role of the underlying hyperparameters in the trade-off between overprovisioning and slices' isolation. Finally, using reliability theory, we provide a closed-form analysis for the lower bound of the so-called reliable convergence probability and showcase the effect of the violation rate on it.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2959186","research projects AGAUR(grant numbers:2017-SGR-891); SPOT5G(grant numbers:TEC2017-87456-P); 5G-SOLUTIONS(grant numbers:856691); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931583","5G;deep neural networks;dynamic slicing;non-convex optimization;reliability theory;SDN/NFV;SLA;violation rate","Logic gates;Neural networks;5G mobile communication;Deep learning;Resource management;Reliability theory;Virtualization","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;probability;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","live cellular network;low-complexity slices;virtual network function;violation rate-based SLA;bounds-based SLA;5G networks;dynamic end-to-end slicing;resource provisioning;physical resource blocks;baseband processing resources;massive key performance indicators datasets;offline SLA-constrained deep learning;software defined networking;network function virtualization;fifth generation networks;data forwarding elements;SDN controller connections;gated recurrent unit;multislice deep neural networks;service level agreement;DNN offline optimization tasks;nonzero sum two-player game","","8","","24","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, a subset of the antennas of virtual wireless networks transmits pilot symbols for estimating the CSI and use the estimated CSI dataset to train and estimate the remaining channels and future CSI for virtual networks using machine learning algorithms. This helps not only to predict the CSI with least overhead and fulfills the service demands of users but also to reduce the power consumption and computation overhead in the network. Predicted CSI is leveraged for RF slicing for virtual wireless networks. Simulation results show that the proposed SBLR for predicting CSI results in lower BER and higher data rate for the wireless users.

Fulfilling these tasks is challenging since network infrastructure becomes increasingly complicated and heterogeneous. One promising solution is to leverage the great potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which has been explored to provide solutions ranging from channel prediction to autonomous network management, as well as network security. As of today, however, the state of the art of integrating AI into wireless networks is mainly limited to use a dedicated AI algorithm to tackle a specific problem. A unified framework that can make full use of AI capability to solve a wide variety of network problems is still an open issue. Hence, this paper will present the concept of intelligence slicing where an AI module is instantiated and deployed on demand.

Without NS, the 5G requirements in terms of flexibility, optimal resource utilization, and investment returns cannot materialize. Before slicing is commercially available, different sections of the 5G architecture should be modified to include NS.

We envision that 5G NS can emerge as a game changer that accelerates the development of FMC while counterintuitively opening up opportunities for fixed operators and the like in need of higher access network capability by leveraging NS-assisted FMC. In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation.
