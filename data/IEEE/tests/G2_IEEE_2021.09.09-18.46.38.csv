In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for the scenario where multiple service providers share the same pool of resources, while the exclusive allocation to different providers is still an open issue due to the associated complexity. In this work, we define a policy-based admission mechanism for exclusive intra-service slice allocation, at fine and adaptable timescales. In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computational-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In a wire-wireless network scenario, any mechanism that proposes to manage and allocate resources to implement slicing in wireless devices will require knowledge of the channel characteristics.

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC Discovery Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper considers network slicing aware optimal resource allocation in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. We define a heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) framework for a sliced radio access network with per-slice zeroforcing beamforming and jointly optimize power and bandwidth allocation across slices and users. The Pareto boundary of this multi-objective optimization problem is obtained by two different algorithms based on the utility profile and scalarization approaches combined with generalized fractional programming. Numerical results show the merits of jointly allocating bandwidth and transmission power and how throughput and global energy efficiency are influenced by slice specific QoS requirements.","","978-3-8007-4541-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8385482","","","","","","2","","","","14 Jun 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Existing approaches fail in efficiently handling the heterogeneous network traffic because of the complicated network environment and dynamic vehicle density. Recently, the fog-radio access network with network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill the demands of the maldistributed network traffic. However, available fog resources as well as network traffic are all dynamic and unpredictable due to high mobility of vehicles, which results in weak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose a smart slice scheduling scheme in vehicular fog radio access networks. This scheduling scheme is formed as a Markov decision process. Accordingly, an intelligent algorithm for network slices is proposed based on the Monte Carlo tree search in terms of a new metric cross entropy, which is able to allocate the resource allocation for the match of traffic load in the time-space domain. This slice scheduling algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network traffic. Furthermore, this paper first reveals the relationship between road traffic and the IoV resource based on the metric perception-reaction time. A collaborative scheduling scheme is proposed to tune the road traffic speed to further release available IoV resource under the heavy traffic load. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several baselines in terms of throughput and delay with low complexity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2900234","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61374189,61620106011,61601097); Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile MCM(grant numbers:20160304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z011); Zhongshan City Project(grant numbers:180809162197874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644035","V-FRAN;Network Slicing;Cross Entropy;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Interference;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","entropy;Internet of Things;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;tree searching;vehicular ad hoc networks","resource allocation;slice scheduling algorithm;collaborative scheduling scheme;road traffic speed;release available IoV resource;heavy traffic load;modern transportation systems;intense information exchange;heterogeneous network traffic;complicated network environment;dynamic vehicle density;fog-radio access network;network slicing;maldistributed network traffic;available fog resources;weak resource utilization;smart slice scheduling scheme;vehicular fog radio access networks;network slices;smart network slicing;vehicular fog-RAN;Internet of Vehicles;Markov decision process;Monte Carlo tree search;metric cross entropy","","22","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Legacy models that aim at forecasting traffic demands fail to capture these key economic aspects of network operation. To close this gap, we present DeepCog, a deep neural network architecture inspired by advances in image processing and trained via a dedicated loss function. Unlike traditional traffic volume predictors, DeepCog returns a cost-aware capacity forecast, which can be directly used by operators to take short- and long-term reallocation decisions that maximize their revenues.

"Adversarial Machine Learning for Flooding Attacks on 5G Radio Access Network Slicing","Y. Shi; Y. E.

Each communication request comes with quality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and latency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and processing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward can be measured by the weight (priority) of this request. The accumulated reward over time should be maximized by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network slicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume the 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds a request generation algorithm through reinforcement learning that decides on how to craft fake requests to maximize the reward of fake requests over time, which in turn minimizes the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the reward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be achieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is more effective than other benchmark attacks such as generating random fake requests and fake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement). Finally, we evaluate how the attack performance depends on system parameters such as the weight and the generation rate of fake requests, and the channel condition. Our results show that the flooding attack poses a major threat for network slicing in terms of starving 5G RAN resources and denying service to real network slicing requests.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473567","U.S. Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473567","","Weight measurement;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Throughput;Quality of experience","","","","","","43","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, considering the imbalance of wireless resource utilization caused by the space-time difference between application scenarios, a shared proportional fairness scheme is proposed to achieve efficient and differentiated utilization of wireless resources.

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","25","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed service deployment algorithm achieves 100% in terms of both overall resource utilization and admission for higher priority slices in some scenarios in bandwidth-constrained contexts, which cannot be achieved by other existing schemes due to priority constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044951","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-108713RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294018","5G;network slicing;network services;quality of service;virtual network function;SKM","Quality of service;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Network slicing;Network topology;Routing","5G mobile communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","quality of service;QoS;network function virtualization technology;end-to-end network slices;intelligent resource allocation algorithms;network resources;NFV architecture;resource allocation strategy;resource utilization optimization;service deployment algorithm;priority slices;NFV aware network service;squatting-kicking model;5G mobile communication;SKM;intelligent Network slicing","","","","46","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA.

This relates to performance indicators including network delay, data rate, reliability as well as security. To meet these criteria, 5G aims to provide network slices, i.e., virtually independent architectures on top of a single, unified communication infrastructure. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been identified as key technologies for implementing such a solution. This work utilizes these ingredients in conjunction for providing isolated end-to-end slices, from wireline cloud servers over the Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based Long Term Evolution (LTE) Radio Access Network (RAN) down to individual User Equipments (UEs). Thereby, a prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution is designed and implemented. The system enables independent management of each slice by either its respective owner or the ICT infrastructure operator. Also, resources are allocated dynamically to slice tenants in order of their priority. A comprehensive empirical evaluation based on real-world traffic patterns, such as Floating Car Data (FCD), is given. Hence, compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - crucial to stable operation of e.g., SGs - is demonstrated for up- and downlink traffic flows.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644145","","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;Network slicing;Quality of service;Control systems;Bridges;Software","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computer network reliability;file servers;Long Term Evolution;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","Network Function Virtualization;isolated end-to-end slices;ICT infrastructure operator;slice tenants;comprehensive empirical evaluation;SGs;Smart Grids;virtually independent architectures;single communication infrastructure;unified communication infrastructure;performance indicators;information and communication technology topologies;software-defined end-to-end network slicing;ICT topologies;Internet of Things;Industry 4.0;Vehicle-to-Everything;network delay;data rate;reliability;single unified communication infrastructure;NFV;SDN;wireline cloud servers;software-defined radio-based Long Term Evolution radio access network;SDR-based LTE RAN;prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution;resource allocation;real-world traffic patterns;service level agreements;user equipments","","10","","37","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761736","","Quality of service;Switches;Radio access networks;Distributed databases;Network architecture;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth","learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication computing","handoff mechanism;future mobile networks;extremely diverse communication requirements;UE-BS-NS;three-layer association;conventional policies;handoff cost;user QoS requirements;RAN slicing;action space;multiple users;data sparsity problem;user mobility;modified distributed Q-learning algorithm;handoff decisions;data sharing mechanism;LESS mechanism;target base station;traditional handoff policies;smart handoff policy;tailored quality of service;multiagent reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing","","6","","12","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this respect, a challenging task for the owner of the radio access network infrastructure (i.e. the network provider) is the spectrum planning of multi-tenant scenarios. This paper proposes different alternatives of hiring capacity to the provider as well as a set of spectrum planning strategies, each giving a certain degree of flexibility to allocate resources per tenant.

However, the introduction of network slicing into radio access networks (RAN) can greatly increase user handover complexity in cellular networks. Specifically, both physical resource constraints on base stations (BSs) and logical connection constraints on network slices (NSs) should be considered when making a handover decision. Moreover, various service types call for an intelligent handover scheme to guarantee the diversified QoS requirements. As such, in this article, a multiagent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handover Scheme, named LESS, is proposed, with the purpose of minimizing handover cost while maintaining user QoS. Due to the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity caused by user mobility, conventional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot be applied directly. To solve these difficulties, LESS exploits the unique characteristics of slicing in designing two algorithms: 1) LESS-DL, a distributed Q-learning algorithm to make handover decisions with reduced action space but without compromising handover performance; 2) LESS-QVU, a modified Q-value update algorithm which exploits slice traffic similarity to improve the accuracy of Q-value evaluation with limited data. Thus, LESS uses LESS-DL to choose the target BS and NS when a handover occurs, while Q-values are updated by using LESS-QVU. The convergence of LESS is theoretically proved in this article. Simulation results show that LESS can significantly improve network performance. In more detail, the number of handovers, handover cost and outage probability are reduced by around 50%, 65%, and 45%, respectively, when compared with traditional methods.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3031079","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971099); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663476); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S02476X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223714","Handover;RAN slicing;multi-agent reinforcement learning;quality of service","Handover;Quality of service;Network slicing;Radio access networks;Cellular networks","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","cellular networks;handover decision;multiagent reinforcement learning;smart handover scheme;QoS;reinforcement learning algorithms;distributed Q-learning algorithm;modified Q-value update algorithm;handover mechanism;radio access network slicing;mobile networks;slice traffic","","3","","31","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The network slicing identified as a multiple logical network, where each network slice dedicates as an end-to-end network and works independently with other slices on a common physical network resources. Most user devices have more than one smart wireless interfaces to connect to different radio access technologies (RATs) such as WiFi and LTE, thereby network operators utilize this facility to offload mobile data traffic. Therefore, it is important to enable a network slicing to manage different RATs on the same logical network as a way to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem and enables a slice to control its users' mobility across different access networks. In this paper, we propose a mobility management architecture based network slicing where each slice manages its users across heterogeneous radio access technologies such as WiFi, LTE and 5G networks. In this architecture, each slice has a different mobility demands and these demands are governed by a network slice configuration and service characteristics. Therefore, our mobility management architecture follows a modular approach where each slice has individual module to handle the mobility demands and enforce the slice policy for mobility management. The advantages of applying our proposed architecture include: i) Sharing network resources between different network slices; ii) creating logical platform to unify different RATs resources and allowing all slices to share them; iii) satisfying slice mobility demands.","","978-1-5386-5395-1","10.1109/WAINA.2018.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418082","5G Network;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution (LTE);WiFi;Software Defined Networking (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Mobility Management;IP Flow;Data offloading","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Computer architecture;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","mobility management architecture;efficient network connectivity;software defined network;multiple logical network;network slice dedicates;end-to-end network;common physical network resources;network operators;network slice configuration;service characteristics;RAT based network slicing;spectrum scarcity problem mitigation;heterogeneous radio access technologies","","3","","12","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, the 5th Generation of Mobile Communication Networks (5G) aims to fulfill Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vertical industries. This is achieved by deploying several, virtually dedicated networks, known as slices, on top of a unified, physical communication infrastructure. While various solutions have been presented for Core Network Slicing, the here presented approach aims to provide an end-to-end solution by allocating Radio Access Network (RAN) resources, realizing slicing for mission-critical applications via a novel scheduler design. A proof of concept is provided by way of detailed empirical evaluations, based on IoT scenarios from the energy sector (i.e., Smart Grids). The proposed RAN Network Slicing solution is shown to reliably sustain service guarantees of critical applications, while coexisting with non-critical services.

To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-2522-0","10.1109/NCA.2019.8935064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935064","Network Slicing;IEEE 802.11ah;Restricted Access Window (RAW);Quality of Service (QoS);Software Defined Networks (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Radio Access Technologies (RATs)","Network slicing;Quality of service;Software;Network function virtualization;Measurement;Hardware;Standards","application program interfaces;quality of service;radio access networks;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication control;virtualisation;wireless LAN","wireless network infrastructure;IEEE 802.11ah Networks;virtual network function;software defined network controller;IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point;slicing templates;neighbor slices;virtual network slicing broker","","2","","13","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, this is associated with high costs and lengthy roll-out times. Therefore it is desirable for multiple tenants to share one Physical Network (PN). However, this may compromise service guarantees, potentially violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Network slicing aims to address this challenge by transparently dividing one common infrastructure into multiple, logically independent networks. Thereby tenants are isolated from one another, ensuring the fulfillment of hard performance guarantees. As slicing is central to realizing the potential of 5G networks, this work presents a novel approach based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) driven queueing strategies.

Our proposed DeepSlice model will be able to make smart decisions and select the most appropriate network slice, even in case of a network failure.","","978-1-7281-3885-5","10.1109/UEMCON47517.2019.8993066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993066","5G Cellular Networks;Network Slicing;Machine Learning;Deep Learning Neural Networks;Network Slicing Optimization;Survivability of Network Functions","","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;cloud computing;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","appropriate network slice;intelligent resource allocation;network Key Performance Indicators;in-network deep learning;network availability;network load efficiency;DeepSlice model;5G network performance;communication networks;data-driven decision making;end-to-end network resource allocation;multiple independent tenants;mobile operators;high-speed user connectivity;high-reliability standards;5G mobile network;cellular communications;deep learning approach;network failure","","19","","14","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It appears that 5G networks will deploy soon and offer impressive improvements in user-experience quality as well as business growth for operators and the digital economy as a whole. However, this does not mean that it will be a fully functional, end-to-end network. In fact, the primary deployments will target nonstandalone models where the gNB (the 5G base station) will interface into the network using the 4G evolved-packet core. Clearly, the 5G-core (5GC) network is still far from being deployed because of a lag in developing the necessary features to support network slicing for various services.

"A Perspective of O-RAN Integration with MEC, SON, and Network Slicing in the 5G Era","C. -L. I; S. Kuklinskí; T. Chen",China Mobile; Orange and Warsaw University of Technology; VTT,"IEEE Network","2 Dec 2020","2020","34","6","3","4","The deployment of 5G mobile networks has begun in earnest. The 5G network is built on a service-based architecture (SBA) which enables programmability of the control plane of 5G Core (5GC) and supports network slicing (NS) in both core and access networks. NS enables the creation of multiple, isolated network slices tailored for specific services with diverse KPI objectives [1]. SBA of 5GC facilitates core network user plane functions (UPF) being deployed near the network edge, which has triggered intense interest in edge activities such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), whereas the traditional Self-Organizing Network (SON) functions are being enhanced continuously in 5G RAN. Meanwhile, the development of open and smart RAN led by an industry alliance, O-RAN, has received great attention. In this short paper we would like to sort out if and how all of the above would fit together in a consistent and efficient manner regarding their architecture aspects and functionalities.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2020.9277891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277891","","5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Self-organizing networks;Information technology;Network slicing;Edge computing;Radio access networks","","","","","","8","","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
