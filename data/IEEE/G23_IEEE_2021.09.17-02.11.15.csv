In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Intelligent Vehicular Systems;Network Slicing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Edge Computing;Fog RAN.","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In particular, we consider the case where optimal admission strategies are pre-computed offline for network state conditions that are representative of typical traffic loads and resource availability. This offline phase is also used to train a Machine learning algorithm; a neural network (NN) learns the best admission policies from a more computationally expensive mechanism in previously studied network conditions. Thus, the NN is used for providing near-optimal admission decisions at runtime under network conditions for which no optimal policy has been computed. The potential of the 5G marketplace in terms of revenue and quality of service is demonstrated for the particular case of services with strict latency constraints by means of a proof of concept tested over network traces from a real network operator. Different strategies are compared for the computation of the admission strategies and results are provided in terms of efficiency in resource utilization, fairness to the service providers, network owners’ revenue and complexity. This study confirms the feasibility of a policy-based approach for exclusive intra-service resource allocation, especially if computational-efficient mechanisms are adopted in the case of missing information about network states.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530689","5G networks;mobile networks;network slicing;admission control;machine learning;neural networks;clustering;Markov processes;pricing","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Complexity theory;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Admission control;Network slicing","","","","","","","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

By leveraging SDN and NVF techniques, it enables the coexistence of several heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs) on top of the same physical infrastructure. Despite the advantages it brings to network operators, network slicing raises a major challenge: Resource allocation of VNs, also known as the virtual network embedding problem (VNEP). VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach. Starting with an initial solution given by the heuristics our approach can find an amelioration, with an improvement in the order of 35%.","2331-9860","978-1-7281-9794-4","10.1109/CCNC49032.2021.9369463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369463","5G;Virtual Network Embedding;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Relational Graph Convolutional Neural Networks;Resource Allocation","5G mobile communication;NP-hard problem;Network slicing;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Resource management;Convolutional neural networks","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);embedded systems;graph theory;mobile computing;optimisation;resource allocation;virtualisation","network slicing;heterogeneous virtual networks;network operators;virtual network embedding problem;NP-hard problem;DRL-based approaches;relational graph convolutional neural networks;VNEP heuristics;deep reinforcement learning;exploration-exploitation dilemma;5G network slicing;beyond 5G network slicing;resource allocation","","","","19","","11 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate the increasing complexity of network slicing in 5G, we propose to leverage the recent advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies for automated network operation. Specifically, we propose intelligent network slicing architecture for V2X services, where network functions and multi-dimensional network resources are virtualized and assigned to different network slices. In achieving optimized slicing intelligently, several critical techniques, including mobile data collection and the design of an ML algorithm, are discussed to tackle the related challenges.

Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as nowadays networks are increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and large-dimensioned. This contradicts the dominant network slicing solutions that only customize immediate performance over one snapshot of the system in the literature. Instead, this paper first presents a two-stage slicing optimization model with time-averaged metrics to safeguard the network slicing in the dynamical networks, where prior environmental knowledge is absent but can be partially observed at runtime. Directly solving an off-line solution to this problem is intractable since the future system realizations are unknown before decisions. Therefore, we propose a learning augmented optimization approach with deep learning and Lyapunov stability theories. This enables the system to learn a safe slicing solution from both historical records and run-time observations. We prove that the proposed solution is always feasible and nearly optimal, up to a constant additive factor.

Towards delivering the anticipated massive connectivity requirements with optimal energy and spectral efficiency besides low hardware cost, this paper presents an enabling framework for 6G networks, which utilizes two emerging technologies, namely, non-coherent communications and backscatter communications (BsC).

To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few.

So far, there has been a huge investment from 5G Berlin Innovation Cluster to deliver a unique infrastructure providing opportunities for research centres, SMEs, and start-ups to develop novel solutions and products [1]. In this regard, there has been a complementary activity from Berlin Centre for Digital Transformation to develop a three-node optical network, which connects three Fraunhofer institutes, HHI, FOKUS, and IPK in a metro ring structure [2]. Additionally, there is a recently funded German national project (OTB-5G+) to develop an Open Testbed Berlin for 5G and Beyond, which will deliver a three-node ROADM network. These activities along with some other ones, like the presence of a Berlin node for two of the EU 5G trial projects (i.e., 5Genesis [3] and 5Gvinni [4]), have made Berlin a strategic spot in the evolution of the EU 5G ecosystem. Fraunhofer HHI hosts several aspects of the above-mentioned infrastructure including the 3-node ROADM metro network testbed, which provide a great opportunity to perform real-field experiments with 5G-ready RAN infrastructure and edge compute capability for realizing low-latency end-to-end use-cases. This metro network is SDN controlled and hosts edge compute node capabilities. Additionally, it could offer NFV services and will eventually support network slicing. Regarding the RAN infrastructure, currently, there are LTE base stations installed, which operate at 2.6 GHz. They will be upgraded to 5G base stations operating at 3.7 GHz as soon as they become available. The access segment, which is based on a passive WDM network, is expected to be extended by sophisticated mm-wave and optical-wireless communication links as bridges demonstrating the network extensions where optical fibers cannot be deployed. This network will be an SDN-enabled allowing the inclusion of several street 5G access points to the infrastructure. The three-node ROADM test-bed described above and shown in Fig. 1 will also host several demonstrations, including the final demonstration of metro-haul project [5]. Two of the ROADM nodes will be realized as AMEN (i.e., Access-Metro Edge Node) and the last one is MCEN (i.e., Metro-Core Edge Node), both developed in the framework of Metro-Haul project. This network will be also connected to German metro ring. The German metro ring will provide connectivity to our partners' premises, including ADVA, NOKIA, and Infinera enabling field trials and optical transmission tests.Figure 1.A part of the 5G test facilities hosted in Berlin.In this talk, we will present in detail the facilities hosted in Berlin, covering its geographical expansion as well as the hosted optical and wireless technologies.

This capability has opened the opportunity to new business models whereby infrastructure owners can monetize their investment by leasing resources to third parties (i.e. tenants). In this respect, a challenging task for the owner of the radio access network infrastructure (i.e. the network provider) is the spectrum planning of multi-tenant scenarios. This paper proposes different alternatives of hiring capacity to the provider as well as a set of spectrum planning strategies, each giving a certain degree of flexibility to allocate resources per tenant.

Moreover, software defined network (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) empower this architecture to visualize the physical network resources. The network slicing identified as a multiple logical network, where each network slice dedicates as an end-to-end network and works independently with other slices on a common physical network resources. Most user devices have more than one smart wireless interfaces to connect to different radio access technologies (RATs) such as WiFi and LTE, thereby network operators utilize this facility to offload mobile data traffic. Therefore, it is important to enable a network slicing to manage different RATs on the same logical network as a way to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem and enables a slice to control its users' mobility across different access networks. In this paper, we propose a mobility management architecture based network slicing where each slice manages its users across heterogeneous radio access technologies such as WiFi, LTE and 5G networks. In this architecture, each slice has a different mobility demands and these demands are governed by a network slice configuration and service characteristics. Therefore, our mobility management architecture follows a modular approach where each slice has individual module to handle the mobility demands and enforce the slice policy for mobility management. The advantages of applying our proposed architecture include: i) Sharing network resources between different network slices; ii) creating logical platform to unify different RATs resources and allowing all slices to share them; iii) satisfying slice mobility demands.","","978-1-5386-5395-1","10.1109/WAINA.2018.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418082","5G Network;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution (LTE);WiFi;Software Defined Networking (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Mobility Management;IP Flow;Data offloading","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Computer architecture;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","mobility management architecture;efficient network connectivity;software defined network;multiple logical network;network slice dedicates;end-to-end network;common physical network resources;network operators;network slice configuration;service characteristics;RAT based network slicing;spectrum scarcity problem mitigation;heterogeneous radio access technologies","","3","","12","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a new dynamic edge/fog network slicing scheme (EFNS) in which tenants can temporarily lease back to the Infrastructure Provider (InP) unused resources to serve demands exceeding its current resources in stock. To efficiently use the resources, tenants can also lease their subscribers' terminals when idle to act as fog nodes augmenting the infrastructure and service capability of the InP. Our goal is to find an optimal slice request admission policy, which includes slices with augmented resources, to maximize the long-term revenue of the InP. A semi-Markov decision process is used to model the arrival of slice requests by taking into account the dynamics of users' demands and availability of resources. To find the optimal policy under uncertain resource demands, a Q-learning (Q-EFNS) algorithm is developed. Additionally, to improve the convergence time and reduce the computational complexity of Q-learning in large-scale scenarios, a Deep reinforcement learning (DQ-EFNS) algorithm and an enhancement based on a Deep Dueling (Dueling DQ-EFNS) algorithm are presented. Finally, simulation results show improvements in the range between 20% to 60% by our algorithms compared to conventional fixed network slicing when only 8% of the subscribers act as fog nodes. Besides, by using Dueling DQ-EFNS, the optimal slice request admission policy is obtained in just a few iterations.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322631","Dynamic resource allocation;edge/fog network slicing;deep Q-learning;dueling DQN","Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Resource management;Uncertainty","6G mobile communication;computer network management;deep learning (artificial intelligence);distributed processing;Markov processes;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","future 6G wireless networks;storage resources;semiMarkov decision process;optimal policy;dynamic edge network slicing;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;dynamic fog network slicing;computing resources;radio resources;infrastructure provider;unused resources lease back;subscriber terminals leasing;long-term revenue;Q-learning algorithm;DQ-EFNS algorithm;deep dueling algorithm;InP","","","","12","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3108618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524814","6G;security and privacy;AI security;physical layer security;connection security;service security.","Security;6G mobile communication;Privacy;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Systematics;Standards","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","","","","","34","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, a holistic framework that takes into account latency, reliability, availability, scalability, and decision-making under uncertainty is lacking. Driven by recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks, deep learning algorithms have been considered as promising ways of developing enabling technologies for URLLCs in future 6G networks. This tutorial illustrates how domain knowledge (models, analytical tools, and optimization frameworks) of communications and networking can be integrated into different kinds of deep learning algorithms for URLLCs. We first provide some background of URLLCs and review promising network architectures and deep learning frameworks for 6G. To better illustrate how to improve learning algorithms with domain knowledge, we revisit model-based analytical tools and cross-layer optimization frameworks for URLLCs. Following this, we examine the potential of applying supervised/unsupervised deep learning and deep reinforcement learning in URLLCs and summarize related open problems.

Traditionally, each vertical industry utilizes dedicated communications networks. In contrast, the 5th Generation of Mobile Communication Networks (5G) aims to fulfill Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for various vertical industries. This is achieved by deploying several, virtually dedicated networks, known as slices, on top of a unified, physical communication infrastructure. While various solutions have been presented for Core Network Slicing, the here presented approach aims to provide an end-to-end solution by allocating Radio Access Network (RAN) resources, realizing slicing for mission-critical applications via a novel scheduler design. A proof of concept is provided by way of detailed empirical evaluations, based on IoT scenarios from the energy sector (i.e., Smart Grids). The proposed RAN Network Slicing solution is shown to reliably sustain service guarantees of critical applications, while coexisting with non-critical services. Application-dependent, dynamic, inter-slice resource sharing enables an efficient use of available RAN spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate dynamic adaptation of slices to channel quality, ensuring reliable operation of Industrial IoT.","","978-1-7281-0960-2","10.1109/GCWkshps45667.2019.9024677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024677","","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Monitoring;Round robin;Mission critical systems;Quality of service;Resource management","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;software radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling","Radio Access Network resources;mission-critical applications;IoT scenarios;RAN Network Slicing solution;noncritical services;inter-slice resource sharing;available RAN spectrum;Industrial IoT;reliable software-defined RAN Network;mission-critical 5G Communication Networks;Industrial Internet of Things applications;communication infrastructures;Mobile Communication Networks;quality of service requirements;unified communication infrastructure;physical communication infrastructure;Core Network Slicing","","3","","16","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state of the radio access network changes from moment to moment and automatic control of network slicing is necessary to respond to service requirements in real time. Automatic control is applied using deep reinforcement learning that can learn optimal control by repeating trial and error. In this paper, we propose a method to allocate radio resources that satisfy the service requirements regardless of the number of slices using deep reinforcement learning. The proposed method flexibly controls multiple slices by observing the state of one slice and calling a model that controls one slice multiple times. The proposed method was evaluated by simulation using a scenario in which the number of slices changes with time. The results of the evaluation show that variations in slice numbers achieve almost completely satisfying of slice requirements without being affected by other slices.","1976-7684","978-1-7281-4199-2","10.1109/ICOIN48656.2020.9016577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016577","network slicing;reinforcement learning;radio access network;5G","Resource management;Optimal control;5G mobile communication;Throughput;Delays;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimal control;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management","radio resource allocation method;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing;end-to-end network slicing;radio access network;automatic control;radio resources;5th generation of mobile communications","","3","","20","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therein, demand-aware resource allocation is of significant importance to network slicing. In this paper, we consider a scenario that contains several slices in a radio access network with base stations that share the same physical resources (e.g., bandwidth or slots). We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem by considering the varying service demands as the environment state and the allocated resources as the environment action. In order to reduce the effects of the annoying randomness and noise embedded in the received service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio (SSR) and spectrum efficiency (SE), we primarily propose generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the action-value distribution driven by minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated action-value distribution and the target action-value distribution. We put forward a reward-clipping mechanism to stabilize GAN-DDQN training against the effects of widely-spanning utility values. Moreover, we further develop Dueling GAN-DDQN, which uses a specially designed dueling generator, to learn the action-value distribution by estimating the state-value distribution and the action advantage function. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed GAN-DDQN and Dueling GAN-DDQN algorithms through extensive simulations.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2959185","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1301003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701439,61731002); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019C01002,2019C03131); Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019LC0AB01); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY20F010016); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019QNA5010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931561","Network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;distributional reinforcement learning;generative adversarial network;GAN;5G","Resource management;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Mathematical model;Generative adversarial networks;Reinforcement learning;Generators","5G mobile communication;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","resource management;network slicing;5G communications system;demand-aware resource allocation;radio access network;physical resources;spectrum efficiency;estimated action-value distribution;service level agreement satisfaction ratio;generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network;GAN-powered deep distributional reinforcement learning;Dueling GAN-DDQN algorithms;GAN-DDQN training;target action-value distribution","","20","","48","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the hardware-specific MAR is costly and heavy, and the App-based MAR requires an additional download and installation and it also lacks cross-platform ability. These limitations hamper the pervasive promotion of MAR. This paper argues that mobile Web AR (MWAR) holds the potential to become a practical and pervasive solution that can effectively scale to millions of end-users because MWAR can be developed as a lightweight, cross-platform, and low-cost solution for end-to-end delivery of MAR. The main challenges for making MWAR a reality lie in the low efficiency for dense computing in Web browsers, a large delay for real-time interactions over mobile networks, and the lack of standardization. The good news is that the newly emerging 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) cellular networks can mitigate these issues to some extent via techniques such as network slicing, device-to-device communication, and mobile edge computing. In this paper, we first give an overview of the challenges and opportunities of MWAR in the 5G era. Then we describe our design and development of a generic service-oriented framework (called MWAR5) to provide a scalable, flexible, and easy to deploy MWAR solution. We evaluate the performance of our MWAR5 system in an actually deployed 5G trial network under the collaborative configurations, which shows encouraging results. Moreover, we also share the experiences and insights from our development and deployment, including some exciting future directions of MWAR over 5G and B5G networks.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2019.09.010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851462","5G;edge computing;augmented reality;mobile augmented reality;Web augmented reality","5G mobile communication;Browsers;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Augmented reality;Edge computing;Smart phones","5G mobile communication;augmented reality;groupware;Internet;mobile computing;smart phones","mobile Web AR;low-cost solution;dense computing;Web browsers;mobile networks;device-to-device communication;mobile edge computing;MWAR5 system;wearable devices;computer vision;hardware-specific MAR;cross-platform ability;B5G networks;mobile augmented reality;mobile Web augmented reality;5G trial network;app-based MAR;collaborative configurations","","4","","","","27 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In order to enable this transition, an end-to-end comprehensive 5G architecture is needed, with capabilities to support the use cases of the different vertical industries. A key feature of this architecture is the implementation of network slicing over a single infrastructure to provision highly heterogeneous vertical services, as well as a network slicing management system capable of handling simultaneous slices. On top of the network slicing technology, functionality needs to be devised to deploy the slices required by the different vertical players and provide them with a suitable interface to manage their slice. In this article, we design a 5G mobile network architecture to support vertical industries. The proposed architecture builds on ongoing standardization efforts at 3GPP and ETSI, and incorporates additional modules to provide enhanced MANO and control functionality as well as artificial-intelligence-based data analytics.

Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g., automotive, smart factories, e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in a cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel network slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted Blockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond traditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the Intermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to allocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and re-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable manner.

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems;Indium phosphide","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resource-multiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2922668","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005); Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736403","RAN slicing;resource scheduling;deep learning;reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Resource management;Machine learning","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","resource utilization;performance isolation;5G radio access network slicing;next-generation mobile networks;resource-multiplexing gain;specific service requirements;diversified service requirements;iRSS;collaborative learning framework;deep learning;reinforcement learning;time-scale resource allocation;time-scale network dynamics;unexpected network states;online decision modules;resource scheduling decisions;online resource scheduling requirements;user mobility;5G RAN slicing;intelligent resource scheduling","","25","","34","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals.

With the powerful Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology available, network slices can be rapidly deployed and centrally managed, giving rise to simplified management, high resource utilization, and cost-efficiency. This is achieved by realizing NSs on general-purpose hardware, hence, replacing traditional middleboxes. However, realizing fast deployment of end-to-end network slices still requires intelligent resource allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources and ensure QoS among different slice categories during congestion cases. This is especially important at the links of the network because of the scarcity of their resources. Consequently, this paper proposes a paradigm based on NFV architecture aimed at providing the massive computational capacity required in the NSs and supporting the resource allocation strategy proposed for multiple slice networks based on resources utilization optimization using a proposed and analyzed Squatting-Kicking model (SKM). SKM is a suitable algorithm for dynamically allocating network resources to different priority slices along paths and improving resource utilization under congested scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed service deployment algorithm achieves 100% in terms of both overall resource utilization and admission for higher priority slices in some scenarios in bandwidth-constrained contexts, which cannot be achieved by other existing schemes due to priority constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044951","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-108713RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294018","5G;network slicing;network services;quality of service;virtual network function;SKM","Quality of service;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Network slicing;Network topology;Routing","5G mobile communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;virtualisation","quality of service;QoS;network function virtualization technology;end-to-end network slices;intelligent resource allocation algorithms;network resources;NFV architecture;resource allocation strategy;resource utilization optimization;service deployment algorithm;priority slices;NFV aware network service;squatting-kicking model;5G mobile communication;SKM;intelligent Network slicing","","","","46","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, to meet diverging use case requirements regarding network data rate, delay, security, reliability and flexibility, dedicated communication infrastructures are employed. Yet, this is associated with high costs and lengthy roll-out times. Therefore it is desirable for multiple tenants to share one Physical Network (PN). However, this may compromise service guarantees, potentially violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Network slicing aims to address this challenge by transparently dividing one common infrastructure into multiple, logically independent networks. Thereby tenants are isolated from one another, ensuring the fulfillment of hard performance guarantees. As slicing is central to realizing the potential of 5G networks, this work presents a novel approach based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) driven queueing strategies. The developed solution is comprehensively evaluated with realistic traffic in a physical testing environment. Highly demanding critical infrastructure use cases, with multiple service levels per slice, are used to validate performance and demonstrate functionalities such as dynamic data rate allocation.","","978-1-5386-4633-5","10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460110","","5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Bridges;Performance evaluation;Critical infrastructure;Resource management","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;quality of service;software defined networking;virtualisation","communication infrastructures;physical network;service level agreements;network slicing;shared 5G infrastructures;critical communications;dynamic data rate allocation;logically independent networks;service guarantees;lengthy roll-out;network data rate","","17","","36","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main outcome of the 5G-Blueprint project will result in a blueprint for the future cooperation between public, private, and semi-private parties (e.g., ports), empowered by 5G technologies and gaining new insights related to the architecture, governance, and relevant business models of CAM services.","2575-4912","978-1-6654-1526-2","10.1109/EuCNC/6GSummit51104.2021.9482459","European Commission(grant numbers:952189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9482459","5G communications;teleoperated transport;logistics;vehicular communications;remotely operated vessels and trucks","5G mobile communication;Biological system modeling;Standardization;Pressing;Seaports;Artificial intelligence;Business","","","","","","10","","28 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the diversity of these services, slice deployment and orchestration are essential to guarantee service performance in a cost-effective way. Here, we propose an Artificial Intelligence framework for cross-slice admission and congestion control that simultaneously considers communication, computing, and storage resources to maximize resources utilization and operator revenue. First, we propose a smart feature extraction solution to analyze the characteristics of incoming requests together with the already deployed slices, and then automatically evaluates the request requirements to make appropriate decisions. Second, we design an online algorithm that controls the slice admission based on their priorities, the arrival and departure characteristics, and the available resources. To mitigate system overloading, our framework dynamically adjusts resources allocated to low priority slices, thereby reducing the dropping probability of new slice requests. The proposed algorithm offers outstanding advantages over traditional static approaches by automatically adapting the controller decisions to the system changes. Simulation results show that our framework significantly improves the resource utilization and reduces the slice request dropping probabilities up to 44% as compared to the baseline schemes.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2019.2952882","France-Singapore MERLION 2017-2018, Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure NSoE(grant numbers:DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906,WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080)); Singapore MOE Tier(grant numbers:1 2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015- NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWTEP003- 041); 5G-MoNArch project(grant numbers:761445); Phase II of the 5th Generation Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) program partially; European Commission within the Horizon 2020 Framework Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896931","Network slicing;reinforcement learning;admission and congestion control","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Noise measurement;Computer architecture","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;probability;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network planning","slice request dropping probabilities;online algorithm;arrival characteristics;departure characteristics;5G services;5G networks;cross-slice admission;network slicing;slice deployment;artificial intelligence framework;resource utilization;controller decisions;low priority slices;smart feature extraction solution;operator revenue;storage resources;congestion control","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This relates to performance indicators including network delay, data rate, reliability as well as security. To meet these criteria, 5G aims to provide network slices, i.e., virtually independent architectures on top of a single, unified communication infrastructure. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been identified as key technologies for implementing such a solution. This work utilizes these ingredients in conjunction for providing isolated end-to-end slices, from wireline cloud servers over the Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based Long Term Evolution (LTE) Radio Access Network (RAN) down to individual User Equipments (UEs). Thereby, a prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution is designed and implemented. The system enables independent management of each slice by either its respective owner or the ICT infrastructure operator. Also, resources are allocated dynamically to slice tenants in order of their priority. A comprehensive empirical evaluation based on real-world traffic patterns, such as Floating Car Data (FCD), is given. Hence, compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - crucial to stable operation of e.g., SGs - is demonstrated for up- and downlink traffic flows.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644145","","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;Network slicing;Quality of service;Control systems;Bridges;Software","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computer network reliability;file servers;Long Term Evolution;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","Network Function Virtualization;isolated end-to-end slices;ICT infrastructure operator;slice tenants;comprehensive empirical evaluation;SGs;Smart Grids;virtually independent architectures;single communication infrastructure;unified communication infrastructure;performance indicators;information and communication technology topologies;software-defined end-to-end network slicing;ICT topologies;Internet of Things;Industry 4.0;Vehicle-to-Everything;network delay;data rate;reliability;single unified communication infrastructure;NFV;SDN;wireline cloud servers;software-defined radio-based Long Term Evolution radio access network;SDR-based LTE RAN;prototypical 5G end-to-end slicing solution;resource allocation;real-world traffic patterns;service level agreements;user equipments","","10","","37","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With 5G network slicing technology, a wireless private network can be virtualized for each industry to better meet the requirements of smart grid security, reliability and flexibility. Considering the differentiated service characteristics of the smart grid and the challenges of flexibility and adaptability of the communication platform, this paper aims to solve the resource allocation problem of the radio access network (RAN) slice of smart grid. Since the type of service arrival of smart grid is unknown and lacks prior knowledge, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to conduct this research. The mapping from the RAN slice resource management to DRL of the smart grid is analyzed at first, and then discussion from the elastic application and the real-time application is presented. Furthermore, a smart grid RAN slice allocation strategy based on DRL is proposed. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can satisfy the maximization of the resource allocation demand of the smart grid on the RAN side while reducing the cost.","","978-1-7281-1973-1","10.1109/ComComAp46287.2019.9018826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018826","Green IoT;smart grid;5G;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning","Smart grids;Resource management;Bandwidth;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Real-time systems;Machine learning","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;radio access networks;resource allocation;smart power grids;telecommunication computing","5G network slicing technology;smart grid security;radio access network;resource allocation problem;communication platform;wireless private network;5G standard;green Internet of Things;RAN slice allocation;green interconnected 5G mobile network;deep reinforcement learning","","","","16","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cognition as a service (CAAS) will be the kernel of the 5G network spanning the devices and terminals. CaaS will load first and stay in memory. All the important services are initialized and it will manage the devices and the resources in the 5G hardware. CaaS will help in creating the new ecosystems which are based on the low reaction times. For example, autonomous cars, robot as a services and self-acting machines require very low reaction time.Cognitive capabilities are provided by CaaS and the applications are easily developed based on the APIs. The capabilities are based on techniques such as nonlinear systems, adaptive control, fuzzy systems, and artificial intelligence. Data is gathered from the sensors, terminals, things, and machines. The fixed and mobile low latency networks exchange and transfer the data. CaaS acts as the nervous system to collate, elaborate and exchange the information. CaaS helps in understanding the environment and provides the capability to adapt to changes. The reaction times for adaptation need to be appropriate based on the scenario. This is because the 5G network will have latency in the order of milliseconds. Edge cognition will have low latency in the order of 1 to 5 ms. Centralized cognition will have in the range of 20 to 30 ms. Edge cognition will be near the devices, robots, cars, and machines.

The evolution of 5G towards a truly production-level stage needs to heavily rely on automated end-to-end network operations, use of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cognitive network orchestration and management and minimal manual interventions (zero-touch automation). All these elements are key to implement highly pervasive network infrastructures. Moreover, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can be adopted to implement distributed security and trust through Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties. In this paper, we propose an initial concept of a zero-touch security and trust architecture for ubiquitous computing and connectivity in 5G networks. Our architecture aims at cross-domain security & trust orchestration mechanisms by coupling DLTs with AI-driven operations and service lifecycle automation in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments.

Unlike the core network slicing in a virtualized environment, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still in its infancy and the corresponding realization is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the realization approach of fog RAN slicing, where two network slice instances for hotspot and vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios are concerned and orchestrated. In particular, the framework for RAN slicing is formulated as an optimization problem of jointly tackling content caching and mode selection, in which the time-varying channel and unknown content popularity distribution are characterized. Due to the different users' demands and the limited resources, the complexity of original optimization problem is significant high, which makes traditional optimization approaches hard to be directly applied. To deal with this dilemma, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, whose core idea is that the cloud server makes proper decisions on the content caching and mode selection to maximize the reward performance under the dynamical channel state and cache status. The simulation results demonstrate the performance in terms of hit ratio and sum transmit rate can be significantly improved by the proposal.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.2965927","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003,61925101,61831002,61901044); State Major Science and Technology Special Project(grant numbers:2018ZX03001025,2018ZX033001023); 03 Special Project and 5G Program of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20192ABC03A041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:JQ18016); National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962338","Fog radio access network;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Computer architecture;Resource management;Radio access networks;Optimization","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;time-varying channels;wireless channels","vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios;5G;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;optimization problem;content popularity distribution;content caching;network slice;radio access network slicing;core network;fog-RAN slicing","","10","","44","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the recent years, there is an excessive demand amongst the subscribers for seamless streaming and experiencing videos and other web contents via smart portable phones and gadgets. This scenario has led to a copious and prodigious increase in the network traffic. The content has to traverse across many accesses such as base station, network core and so on, to reach the smart devices. Moreover, it might cause augmented content latency, in specific scenarios the subscribers' request gets repudiated as a result of network congestion and also excessive load in the mobile operators' core network. Therefore, to solve these issues, we propose to develop a novel architecture that brings the computation to the proximity of the user in the 5G edge network. This novel approach allows us to use the internet related services with improved accuracy and low latency. However, an overloaded multi-access edge computing (MEC) system negates the benefits of these advancements, thus providing a degraded quality of experience to the user.

However, how to converge different types of services onto a common UAV network without deploying an individual network solution for each type of service is challenging. We tackle this challenge in this paper through slicing the UAV network, i.e., creating logical UAV networks customized for specific requirements. To this end, we formulate the UAV network slicing problem as a sequential decision problem to provide mobile broadband (MBB) services for ground mobile users while satisfying ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of UAV control and non-payload signal delivery. This problem, however, is difficult to be directly solved mainly due to the sequence-dependent characteristic and the lack of accurate location information of mobile users and accurate and tractable channel gain models in practice. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel solution approach based on learning and optimization methods. Particularly, we develop a distributed learning method to predict mobile users’ locations, where partial user location information stored on each UAV is utilized to train user location prediction networks. To achieve accurate channel gain models, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained by signal measurements at each UAV. To cope with the challenging sequence-dependent characteristic of the problem, we develop a Lyapunov-based optimization framework with provable performance guarantees to decompose the original problem into a sequence of separate optimization subproblems based on the learned results. Finally, an iterative optimization scheme joint with a successive convex approximation technique is exploited to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the Lyapunov-based optimization framework.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3088624","National Research Foundation, Singapore; Infocomm Media Development Authority through the Future Communications Research and Development Program; Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (ARF) Tier 2(grant numbers:T2EP20120-0006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453787","UAV network slicing;URLLC;mobile broadband service;learning and optimization","Ultra reliable low latency communication;Network slicing;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Payloads;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Resource management","","","","","","51","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing method that flexibly allocates RAN resources using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In RANs, the number of slices controlled by a base station fluctuates in terms of user ingress and egress from the base station coverage area and service switching on the respective sets of user equipment. Therefore, when resource allocation depends on the number of slices, resources cannot be allocated when the number of slices changes. We consider a method that makes optimal-resource allocation independent of the number of slices. Resource allocation is optimized using DRL, which learns the best action for a state through trial and error. To achieve independence from the number of slices, we show a design for a model that manages resources on a one-slice-by-one-agent basis using Ape-X, which is a DRL method. In Ape-X, because agents can be employed in parallel, models that learn various environments can be generated through trial and error of multiple environments. In addition, we design a model that satisfies the slicing requirements without over-allocating resources. Based on this design, it is possible to optimally allocate resources independently of the number of slices by changing the number of agents. In the evaluation, we test multiple scenarios and show that the mean satisfaction of the slice requirements is approximately 97%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986050","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:17H01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057705","Deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;RAN slicing;resource management","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Machine learning;Scalability;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication switching","flexible resource block allocation;deep reinforcement learning;radio access network slicing method;RAN resources;optimal-resource allocation;one-slice-by-one-agent basis;fifth-generation mobile communications;RAN slicing method;Ape-X","","6","","34","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Achieving this vision requires a combination of novel physical layer technologies, artificial intelligence tools, standard interfaces, network function virtualization, and software-defined networking principles.

This architectural framework allows the introduction of resource elasticity as a key means to make an efficient use of the computational resources of 5G systems, but adds challenges related to resource sharing and efficiency.

Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture.

Meanwhile, intelligent content caching, which places popular contents at the network edge, can help relieve the backhaul congestion and improve user quality of service (QoS). Joint content caching and network slicing in the wireless backhaul based 5G networks, however, present great potential and challenges. In this paper, we study the joint resource allocation and content caching problem which aims to efficiently orchestrate the resource management in both wireless access and backhaul networks and caching storage repository. Our design objective is to minimize the maximum content request outage probability experienced by users associated with different cells and from different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The underlying optimization problem is a mixed- integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is difficult to tackle.

In the context of 6G, more computing resources are required, a problem that is dealt with by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler’s Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler’s full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup. Finally, we use the Google Cluster Usage Trace dataset to perform real-life simulations and illustrate the effectiveness of IScaler’s multi-application autonomous resource provisioning.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3066625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380677","Resource provisioning;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);service placement;resource scaling;5G;6G;AI;Internet of Everything (IoE)","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Clustering algorithms;Servers;Dynamic scheduling;Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things","","","","","","42","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the reservation of these resources will come at an additional cost to the SP, which motivates the main objective of this paper: To develop a strategy that will allow the SP to determine the optimal amount of resources it should reserve ahead of time so that its future QoS constraints are met with minimal risk of revenue loss (i.e. from over reservation).

Shi",NA; NA; NA,"Game Theory and Machine Learning for Cyber Security","","2021","","","270","288","Machine learning provides automated means to capture complex dynamics of wireless spectrum and support better understanding of spectrum resources and their efficient utilization. As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This chapter identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal‐level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.","","9781119723912","10.1002/9781119723950.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9536303.pdf&bkn=9536219&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Training data;Sensors","","","","","","","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

In many 5G use cases, network requirements vary over time and CSPs must dynamically adapt network slices to satisfy the contractual network slice QoS, cooperating and using each others’ resources, e.g. when resources of a single CSP are not sufficient or suitable to maintain all it’s current SLAs. While this need for dynamic cross-CSP cooperation is widely recognized, realization of this need is not yet possible due to gaps both in business processes and in technical capabilities.In this paper, we present a 5GZORRO approach to dynamic cross-CSP slice scaling. Our approach both enables CSPs to collaborate, providing security and trust with smart multi-party contracts, and facilitates thus achieved collaboration to enable resource sharing across multiple administrative domains, either during slice establishment or when already existing slice needs to expand or shrink. Our approach allows automating both business and technical processes involved in dynamic lifecycle management of cross-CSP network slices, following ETSI’s Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) closed-loop architecture, and relying on resource-sharing Marketplace, Distributed Ledger (DL), and Operational Data Lake.

These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is leveraged to solve this problem by regarding the varying demands and the allocated bandwidth as the environment state and action, respectively. In order to obtain better quality of experience (QoE) satisfaction ratio and spectrum efficiency (SE), we propose generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the distribution of state-action values. Furthermore, we estimate the distributions by approximating a full quantile function, which can make the training error more controllable. In order to protect the stability of GAN-DDQN's training process from the widely-spanning utility values, we also put forward a reward-clipping mechanism.

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience. To validate our approach, we evaluate the agent under different configurations and in real-world settings and present the results.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3074618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409935","5G and beyond;Service Function Chain;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Multi-access Edge Computing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Management and Orchestration.","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Channel allocation;Servers;Resource management","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To ensure improved quality of experience (QoE) of users, 5G and beyond networks require ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). The successful realization of the URLLC entails the advent of new technological concepts. Therefore, this article presents an overview of the enabling techniques for the URLLC. Classification of the enabling techniques is done and an extensive review of the literature is presented to identify the state-of-the-art techniques, limitations, and the potential approaches for alleviating the limitations. It is observed that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled edge computing and caching solutions are widely explored as promising techniques to effectively guarantee low latency and reliable content acquisition while reducing redundant network traffic and improving the QoE. Therefore, we present a classification of the AI-enabled edge caching solutions and discuss various mechanisms of the caching agents. In particular, we investigate the use of deep learning (DL), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and federated learning (FL) algorithms. Subsequently, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art edge caching schemes and demonstrate the performance gains of FL frameworks over conventional centralized and decentralized DL and DRL frameworks. We confirm that FL edge caching is a viable mechanism in 5G and beyond networks.

This is achieved by bringing the analysis functions closer to the data collection points. To this end, we introduce in this paper statistical federated learning (SFL) provisioning models that can learn over a live network non independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets in an offline fashion while respecting slice-level service level agreement (SLA) long-term statistical constraints. Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Q-th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds. These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. Numerical results on various slice-level resources show that SFL enables SLA enforcement while significantly reducing the overhead compared to both state-of-the-art FedAvg and centralized constrained deep learning schemes. Finally, we provide an analysis for the lower bound of the so-called reliable convergence probability in the SFL setup.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3109377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534716","B5G;cloud-RAN;dynamic slicing;game theory;proxy-Lagrangian;resource allocation;SLA;statistical federated learning;violation rate","Service level agreements;Resource management;Wireless communication;Network slicing;Collaborative work;5G mobile communication;Convergence","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment of radio resources and the degrees of isolation and customization.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2017.1600220WC","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891795","","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Planning;Interference;Computer architecture;Communication channels","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication services;wireless channels","radio access network;radio resource management perspective;network slicing;future 5G networks;future application scenarios;multiple logical networks;common physical network infrastructure;communications service providers;special purpose service providers;radio channel;RAN slicing problem;multicell network;RRM functionalities;RAN slicing approaches","","60","","15","","4 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In particular, we discuss the potential benefits and challenges of the proposed architecture in terms of spectrum and infrastructure sharing. The key implementation aspects of blockchain for 6G, such as a tokenization model for spectrum and infrastructure, the distributed ledger structure, and feasible consensus algorithms, are studied in detail. Finally, we implement three types of smart contracts for service provisioning with semi-persistent, dynamic, and intelligent spectrum trading and analyze the number of transactions for each type. The simulation results show that the average throughput in the case of intelligent spectrum trading is 7 percent higher than that of the semi-persistent trading and 4 percent lower than that of the dynamic trading. From the economic perspective of operators, intelligent trading provides 19 percent more profit than semi-persistent trading and 8 percent less profit than intelligent trading. Intelligent trading also has much lower overhead in the blockchain than dynamic trading, while being very close to the lowest overhead of semi-persistent trading.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2000175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214395","","Blockchain;6G mobile communication;Smart contracts;Regulators;Cryptography;Economics;Real-time systems","6G mobile communication;contracts;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;profitability;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;transaction processing","future 6G networks;fine-grained spectrum;mobile network infrastructure;infrastructure sharing;distributed ledger structure;feasible consensus algorithms;intelligent spectrum trading;intelligent trading;blockchain-empowered framework;decentralized network management;fine-grained spectrum sharing;tokenization model;smart contracts;service provisioning;dynamic spectrum trading;semipersistent spectrum trading","","7","","15","","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

According to the topological properties, resource utilization and delay of the slice nodes, the importance of them is sorted using the VIKOR method. In the slice link configuration stage, the shortest path algorithm is used to obtain the slice link physical path. Considering the delay of the slice link, a strategy for selecting the physical path is proposed.

In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-2522-0","10.1109/NCA.2019.8935064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935064","Network Slicing;IEEE 802.11ah;Restricted Access Window (RAW);Quality of Service (QoS);Software Defined Networks (SDN);Network Function Virtualization (NFV);Radio Access Technologies (RATs)","Network slicing;Quality of service;Software;Network function virtualization;Measurement;Hardware;Standards","application program interfaces;quality of service;radio access networks;software defined networking;software radio;telecommunication control;virtualisation;wireless LAN","wireless network infrastructure;IEEE 802.11ah Networks;virtual network function;software defined network controller;IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point;slicing templates;neighbor slices;virtual network slicing broker","","2","","13","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Slice allocation and placement is an important networking optimization task that still painstakingly tune heuristics to get a sufficient solution. These algorithms use data as input and outputs near-optimal solutions. Thus, we are motivated by replacing this tedious process with the recent deep reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose three approaches for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) slices placement in edge computing (Integer linear programming (ILP), reinforcement learning (RL), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)). Then they are implemented and evaluated. Several scenarios are considered to study the behavior of the algorithms and to quantify the impact of network size.

In this scenario, PN resource utilization can be improved by introducing advanced orchestration functionalities that can intelligently assign and redistribute resources among the slices of different tenants according to the temporal variation of the VN resource requirements. This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues. The benefits of dynamic slicing come at a cost in terms of service degradation (i.e., when not all the resources required by a VN can be provided), but the paper shows that the service degradation level introduced by the proposed solutions is very small.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000A77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273270","5G transport;Dynamic slicing;IP over WDM;Multi-tenant networks;Network virtualization;Software defined networking","Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Dynamic scheduling;Network slicing;Optical fibers","5G mobile communication;integer programming;linear programming;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;software defined networking","dynamic slicing approach;multitenant 5G transport networks;physical network resource utilization;orchestration functionality;software defined networking;network slicing;virtual networks;mixed integer linear programming formulations;heuristic algorithms","","28","","","","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With this paradigm, it is essential to allocate to each slice the needed resources, which requires the ability to forecast their respective demands. To this end, we present DeepCog, a novel data analytics tool for the cognitive management of resources in 5G systems. DeepCog forecasts the capacity needed to accommodate future traffic demands within individual network slices while accounting for the operator's desired balance between resource overprovisioning (i.e., allocating resources exceeding the demand) and service request violations (i.e., allocating less resources than required). To achieve its objective, DeepCog hinges on a deep learning architecture that is explicitly designed for capacity forecasting. Comparative evaluations with real-world measurement data prove that DeepCog's tight integration of machine learning into resource orchestration allows for substantial (50% or above) reduction of operating expenses with respect to resource allocation solutions based on state-of-the-art mobile traffic predictors. Moreover, we leverage DeepCog to carry out an extensive first analysis of the trade-off between capacity overdimensioning and unserviced demands in adaptive, sliced networks and in presence of real-world traffic.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737488","","Resource management;Deep learning;Base stations;Neural networks;Maximum likelihood detection;Nonlinear filters;5G mobile communication","5G mobile communication;cognitive radio;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","cognitive network management;sliced 5G networks;network slicing;future 5G networks;network infrastructure;novel data analytics tool;cognitive management;future traffic demands;individual network slices;resource overprovisioning;deep learning architecture;capacity forecasting;real-world measurement data;resource orchestration;adaptive networks;sliced networks;DeepCog;resource allocation solutions;mobile traffic predictors","","36","","30","","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we target a 5G slice for offering internet-of-things (IoT)-inspired services. In this 5G application segment (e.g., utility or smart metering), utility sensors or devices are expected to last for decades and, operate on tight power budgets, and the system can tolerate periodic stops to check the fidelity of previous transmissions. For this scenario, we employ a service provider-deployed relay that alleviates the IoT devices of their communication burdens. The source transmits for a certain time window or period without requiring acknowledgments (ACK) from the destination. At the end of this window, the destination sends an ACK. If negative, the relay is expected to assist. Thus, the relay transmits only intermittently, in either one transmission time slot or a few time slots, using a suitably chosen higherorder modulation constellation. If no error occurs, the source continues its transmission. The numerical results show that with just a few antennas at the relay, the new scheme provides both a reduction in the number of ARQ transmissions and a superior probability of bit error compared with a reference scheme. We adopt the two-parameter Weibull fading model to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.","","978-1-7281-4873-1","10.1109/GCIoT47977.2019.9058393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058393","Cooperative relaying;Network slicing;5G;IoT;Energy efficiency;Weibull fading","Relays;Noise measurement;5G mobile communication;Modulation;Fading channels;Internet of Things;Protocols","5G mobile communication;automatic repeat request;cooperative communication;error statistics;fading channels;Internet of Things;probability;relay networks (telecommunication)","ARQ-based cooperative relaying scheme;5G IoT slice;classical automatic repeat request-based cooperative relaying scheme;internet-of-things-inspired services;5G application segment;smart metering;utility sensors;tight power budgets;periodic stops;previous transmissions;service provider-deployed relay;IoT devices;time window;ACK;transmission time slot;ARQ transmissions;reference scheme;higher-order modulation constellation","","","","14","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These problems have resulted in low network capacity, high signaling overhead, inefficient data forwarding, and low scalability, which are expected to persist as the stumbling blocks to deploy, support and scale next-generation applications, including smart city and virtual reality. Fifth-generation (5G) cellular networking, along with its salient operational characteristics - including the cognitive and cooperative capabilities, network virtualization, and traffic offload - can address these limitations to cater to future scenarios characterized by highly heterogeneous, ultra-dense, and highly variable environments. Cognitive radio (CR) and cognition cycle (CC) are key enabling technologies for 5G. CR enables nodes to explore and use underutilized licensed channels; while CC has been embedded in CR nodes to learn new knowledge and adapt to network dynamics. CR and CC have brought advantages to a cognition-inspired 5G cellular network, including addressing the spectrum scarcity problem, promoting interoperation among heterogeneous entities, and providing intelligence and autonomous capabilities to support 5G core operations, such as smart beamforming. In this paper, we present the attributes of 5G and existing state of the art focusing on how CR and CC have been adopted in 5G to provide spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, improved quality of service and experience, and cost efficiency. This main contribution of this paper is to complement recent work by focusing on the networking aspect of CR and CC applied to 5G due to the urgent need to investigate, as well as to further enhance, CR and CC as core mechanisms to support 5G.

Recent advances in the domain of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make mechanisms from these domains promising candidates to cope with the complexity regarding the management and orchestration (MANO) of physical and virtual network resources as well as to translate technical Quality of Service (QoS) parameters into user‐centric Quality of Experience (QoE) information.In this chapter, we discuss where and how ML and AI techniques can be applied in the 5G ecosystem. We cover three representative case studies focusing on QoE assessment, deployment of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), and slice management.

The challenge of 5G is to assure the network performance and different quality of service (QoS) requirements of different services, such as machine type communication (MTC), enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) over 5G networks. Unlike the previous ”one size fits all” system, the softwarization, slicing and network capability exposure of 5G provide dynamic programming capabilities for QoS assurance. With the increasing complexity and dynamics of the network behaviors, it is non-trivial for a programmer to develop traditional software codes to schedule the network resources based on expert knowledge, especially when there is no quantitative relationship among the network events and the QoS anomalies. Machine learning is a computer technology that gives computer systems the ability to learn with data and improve performance and accuracy of decision making on a specific task, without being explicitly programmed. The areas of machine learning and communication technology are converging. Supervised learning based QoS assurance architecture for 5G networks was proposed in this paper. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can intelligently learn the network environment and react to dynamic situations. They can learn from the fore passed QoS related information and anomalies, and further reconstruct the relationship between the fore passed data and the current QoS related anomalies automatically and accurately. They, then, can trigger automatic mitigation or provide suggestions. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can also predict future QoS related anomalies with high confidence. In this paper, a case study for QoS anomaly root cause tracking based on decision tree was given to validate the proposed framework architecture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907142","Hubei Province Technology Innovation Project(grant numbers:2018ADC049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673765","5G;architecture;quality of service;supervised learning","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Computer architecture;Training;Knowledge engineering","5G mobile communication;decision making;decision trees;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;synchronisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability","supervised machine learning mechanisms;QoS anomaly root cause tracking;QoS assurance architecture;5G networks;ubiquitous connectivity;high-speed data transfer;machine type communication;enhanced mobile broad band;ultra-reliable low latency communications;network capability exposure;dynamic programming capabilities;network resources;computer technology;computer systems;communication technology;quality of service;software codes;URLLC;MTC;eMBB","","9","","33","OAPA","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Secondly, considering the imbalance of wireless resource utilization caused by the space-time difference between application scenarios, a shared proportional fairness scheme is proposed to achieve efficient and differentiated utilization of wireless resources. Finally, on the basis of ensuring the demand of each slice, the resource allocation algorithm based on the primal-dual interior-point method is used to solve the optimal slice weight allocation to minimize the system delay. Simulation results show that the service traffic prediction mechanism can be used to predict service traffic in the future. The average error rates of SMS, phone, and web traffic will be reduced, so that the user load distribution can be obtained a priori.

However, allocating bandwidth in a finer resolution usually implies larger action space, and unfortunately DQL fails to quickly converge in this case. In this letter, we introduce discrete normalized advantage functions (DNAF) into DQL, by separating the Q-value function as a state-value function term and an advantage term and exploiting a deterministic policy gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to avoid the unnecessary calculation of Q-value for every stateaction pair. Furthermore, as DPGD only works in continuous action space, we embed a k-nearest neighbor algorithm into DQL to quickly find a valid action in the discrete space nearest to the DPGD output.

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT.

Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization.

Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN).

In this paper, we investigate dynamic network slicing strategies with mixed traffics in virtualized radio access network (RAN). Considering versatile users' quality of service (QoS) requirements on transmission delay and rate, coarse resource provisioning scheme and deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous slicing refinement algorithm are proposed. Then, a shape-based heuristic algorithm for user resource customization is devised to improve resource utilization and QoS satisfaction. In principle, the DQN algorithm allocates only the necessary resource to slices to satisfy users' QoS requirements. For fairness in comparison, we reserve all the unused resources back to the slices. In case there is a sudden change in user population in one slice, the algorithm provides isolation. To validate the advantage, system-level simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm balances the satisfaction up to about 100% and resource utilization up to 80% against state-of-the-art solutions. The proposed algorithm also improves the performance of slices in mixed traffics against state-of-the-art benchmarks, which fail to balance satisfaction and resource utilization in some slices.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2918005","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771098); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J068); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan province(grant numbers:2017GFW0128,8ZDYF2265,2018JYO578,2017JY0007); ZTE Innovation Research Fund for Universities Program 2016; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730413","Fifth-generation (5G);network slicing;resource allocation;resource provisioning;user association","Resource management;Quality of service;5G mobile communication;Virtualization;Network slicing;Heuristic algorithms;Radio access networks","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","unused resources;resource utilization;mixed traffics;autonomous resource provisioning;virtualized radio access network;service providers;common shared infrastructure;coarse resource provisioning scheme;shape-based heuristic algorithm;user resource customization;DQN algorithm;dynamic network slicing;autonomous slicing refinement algorithm;deep reinforcement learning;fifth-generation systems;heterogeneous characteristics;versatile users quality of service;QoS satisfaction","","19","","34","IEEE","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio-visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud. This paper presents a novel service virtualization platform (SVP), called 5G-MEDIA SVP, which leverages the principles of NFV and SDN to facilitate the development, deployment, and operation of media services on 5G networks. The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content. The preliminary results of the 5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation are compared against current practice and show that the proposed platform provides enhanced functionality for the operators and infrastructure owners, while ensuring better NS performance to service providers and end users.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2019.2901400","H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies(grant numbers:761699); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667014","5G networks;network functions virtualization;serverless computing;immersive media;remote production;content delivery networks","5G mobile communication;Media;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Streaming media;Tools;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;multimedia communication;optimisation;resource allocation;software defined networking;user experience;virtual reality;virtualisation","5G networks;network architectures;SDN;network function virtualization;NFV;demanding services;networked cloud;media services;infrastructure resource utilization;5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation;software-defined networking;cognitive management;audio-visual quality;service virtualization platform;lifecycle management;user experience;optimization;virtual reality 3-D gaming;edge-to-cloud virtualized multimedia service","","17","","53","OAPA","13 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the networks become increasingly dense, heterogeneous, decentralized, and ad hoc in nature, and they encompass numerous and diverse network entities. Consequently, different objectives, such as high throughput and low latency, need to be achieved in terms of service, and resource allocation must be designed and optimized accordingly. However, considering the dynamics and uncertainty that inherently exist in wireless network environments, conventional approaches for service and resource management that require complete and perfect knowledge of the systems are inefficient or even inapplicable. Inspired by the success of machine learning in solving complicated control and decision-making problems, in this article we focus on deep reinforcement- learning (DRL)-based approaches that allow network entities to learn and build knowledge about the networks and thus make optimal decisions locally and independently.

Mobile operators shall be able to serve all of these requirements using shared network infrastructure's resources. To this end, we propose in this paper a framework for resource orchestration for 5G network slices implementing four Quality of Service pillars. Starting from traffic classification, demands are marked so that they are best served by dedicated logical virtual networks called Network Slices (NSs). To optimally serve multiple NSs over the same physical network, we then implement a new dynamic slicing approach of network resources exploiting Machine Learning (ML). Indeed, as demands change dynamically, a mere recursive optimization leading to progressive convergence towards an optimum slice is not sufficient. Consequently, we need an initial well-informed slicing decision of physical resources from a total available resource pool. Moreover, we formalize both admission control and slice scheduler modules as Knapsack problems. Using our 5G experimental prototype based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), we generate a realistic dataset for evaluating ML based approaches as well as two baselines solutions (i.e. static slicing and uninformed random slicing-decisions). Simulation results show that using regression trees as an ML based approach for both classification and prediction, outperform other alternative solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and throughput.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013129","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Prototypes","5G mobile communication;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;quality of service;regression analysis;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics);virtualisation","knapsack problems;admission control;recursive optimization;regression trees;OAI;open air interface;network infrastructure resources;mobile operators;5G network slices;slicing decision;machine learning;static slicing;ML based approaches;5G experimental prototype;slice scheduler modules;resource pool;physical resources;optimum slice;network resources;dynamic slicing approach;physical network;logical virtual networks;shared network infrastructure;heterogeneous demands;resource orchestration;ML based approach;uninformed random slicing-decisions","","6","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The requirement on computing power becomes often higher than it could be performed on the robot controller itself. Using an external computer introduces, nowadays, significant communication delays that make real-time control difficult or even impossible. Furthermore, to integrate mobile assets in a motion control scenario wired communication cannot be employed. A 5G network / local factory cloud may bridge this gap.

Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents.

Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is challenging. In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been applied widely in various fields such as health, transportation, and the autonomous car. The predictive algorithms will be used in 6G problems. With the rapid developments of deep learning techniques, it is critical to take the security concern into account when applying the algorithms. While machine learning offers significant advantages for 6G, AI models’ security is normally ignored. Due to the many applications in the real world, security is a vital part of the algorithms. This paper proposes a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. The main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G applications for mmWave beam prediction. We also present the adversarial learning mitigation method’s performance for 6G security in millimeter-wave beam prediction application with fast gradient sign method attack. The mean square errors of the defended model under attack are very close to the undefended model without attack.","","978-1-6654-0308-5","10.1109/BlackSeaCom52164.2021.9527756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527756","machine learning;AI;millimeter-wave;beam-forming;adversarial machine learning","6G mobile communication;Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Millimeter wave technology;Transportation;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","13","","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. We then evaluate each class of algorithms in terms of accuracy, sample complexity, and model explainability. Our experiments reveal that, in terms of these three requirements, the gradient boosting and neural network algorithms for SLA decomposition out-perform random forest algorithms, given emulated data sets.","","978-1-7281-5684-2","10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165317","Network slicing;E2E orchestration;SLA;random forest;gradient boosting;neural networks","Machine learning;Network slicing;Data models;Training;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Quality of service","augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;random forests;supervised learning","mobile networks;core networks;total SLA budget;network service operators;SLA decomposition planner;network slicing;supervised machine learning algorithms;neural network algorithms;end-to-end slice SLA decomposition;network service industry;industrial automation;augmented reality;virtual reality","","","","26","","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to continuously rising demands in terms of efficiency and capabilities, complex control and monitoring strategies are employed. These in turn rely on robust, high performance communication networks. As CIs are distributed systems with diverging demands, the deployment of individual networks is often too costly and time consuming. Furthermore, the vast physical scope traditionally results in unacceptably high end-to-end delays. Therefore, a convergence of public and dedicated networks, as well as traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with Information Technology (IT), are considered key aspects of 5G for addressing these challenges. Hence, this paper provides an empirical evaluation of CI communication services on basis of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) driven Edge Clouds (ECs) within a sliced 5G network. By shifting computing resources from the backbone or back office towards the network's access level, ECs allow for drastically reduced delays. Also, the traffic load on several layers of the communication infrastructure is reduced, as data can be kept locally, i.e. close to the source.

In this paper we consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.","","978-3-948377-02-1","10.1109/ITC3249928.2020.00026","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355538","Age of Information;IoT;MDP;pricing","5G mobile communication;Smart cities;Pricing;Telecommunication traffic;Data collection;Internet of Things;Tuning","cloud computing;Internet of Things;optimisation;pricing;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IoT service;optimal pricing scheme;MSP;trade-off between slicing costs;uploaded IoT data;joint traffic offloading;5G IoT networks;5G cellular technology;IoT-based applications;Mobile Service Provider;smart city service;IoT data readings;rescales bandwidth;service functions;5G network slicing functions;heterogeneous access technologies;different site types;different infrastructure providers;service depending;specific access technology;regional sites;IoT data collection patterns;pricing mechanism;traffic load;highly congested locations;more expensive locations;lesser charged ones","","","","20","","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thereby, learning techniques will take a central stage in the sixth generation of wireless communications to cope up with the stringent application requirements. This paper studies the practical limitations of these learning methods in the context of resource management in a non-stationary radio environment. Based on the practical limitations we carefully design and propose supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models to support rate maximization objective under user mobility. We study the effects of practical systems such as latency and reliability on the rate maximization with deep learning models. For common testing in the non-stationary environment, we present a generic dataset generation method to benchmark across different learning models versus traditional optimal resource management solutions.

Accurate fault location is the basis of slice management. In virtualized network model, the function of network elements is software, the underlying layer is highly abstract, the structure changes dynamically, and common cause faults occur frequently, which brings difficulties to fault location. Deep Learning is a machine Learning method that USES Deep Neural Network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers to complete Learning tasks. The essence is that by building a neural network model with multiple hidden layers and using a large amount of training data to learn more useful features, the accuracy of model prediction or classification can be improved. Based on the theory of deep mapping learning algorithm, a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and idle network is designed for centralized wireless network control system. Aiming at the centralized wireless network control system, this paper designs a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and network idleness. The designed sensor network node platform uses the programmable logic controller as the main control chip, contains the data interface module that realizes the communication function between the node and the upper computer, and the acquisition and conditioning module responsible for the collection and conditioning and conversion of the analog signal. At the same time, the TCP and UDP are compared and studied. The accuracy of the model is verified, and the interference distribution of the model and the influence of the D2D inter-pair distance on the system performance are simulated.

However, as the dynamic traffic demands and the mobility in vehicular networks, how to perform RAN slicing efficiently to provide stable quality of service (QoS) for connected vehicles is still a challenge. In order to meet the diversified service request of vehicles in such a dynamic vehicular environment, in this paper, we propose a two-timescale radio resource allocation scheme, namely, LSTM-DDPG, to provide stable service for vehicles. Specifically, for the long-term dynamic characteristics of service request from vehicles, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) to follow the tracks, such that the dedicated resource allocation is executed in a long timescale by using historical data. On the other hand, for the impacts of channel changes caused by high-speed movement in a short period, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is leveraged to adjust the allocated resources. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-DDPG with simulation results, the cumulative probability that the slice supplies a stable performance to the served vehicle within the resource scheduling interval can reach more than 90%. Compared with the conventional deep Q-networks (DQN), the average cumulative probability has increased by 27.8%.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-8964-2","10.1109/VTC2021-Spring51267.2021.9448852","Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448852","Vehicular networks;network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;resource allocation","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Tracking;Network slicing;Simulation;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;quality of service;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","two-timescale resource allocation scheme;vehicular network slicing;diverse use cases;heterogeneous requirements;dynamic traffic demands;vehicular networks;stable quality;connected vehicles;diversified service request;dynamic vehicular environment;two-timescale radio resource allocation scheme;LSTM-DDPG;stable service;long-term dynamic characteristics;short-term memory;dedicated resource allocation;long timescale;high-speed movement;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;deep deterministic policy gradient;allocated resources;served vehicle;resource scheduling interval;conventional deep Q-networks","","","","10","","15 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by numerous variables. In this article, we investigate the reconfiguration within a core network slice with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This problem is also intractable by using conventional Deep Q Network (DQN), as it has a multi-dimensional discrete action space which is difficult to explore efficiently. To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose to exploit Branching Dueling Q-network which incorporates the action branching architecture into DQN to drastically decrease the number of estimated actions. Based on the discrete BDQ network, we develop an intelligent network slice reconfiguration algorithm (INSRA).

In a NS scenario, physical and virtual resources are partitioned among multiple logical networks, named slices, with specific characteristics. The challenge consists in finding efficient strategies to dynamically allocate the network resources among the different slices according to the user requirements. In this paper, we tackle the target problem by exploiting a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach. Our framework is based on a distributed architecture, where multiple agents cooperate towards a common goal. The agent training is carried out following the Advantage Actor Critic algorithm, which makes it possible to handle continuous action spaces. By means of extensive simulations, we show that our strategy yields better performance than an efficient empirical algorithm, while ensuring high adaptability to different scenarios without the need for additional training.","","978-1-6654-3590-1","10.1109/MedComNet52149.2021.9501279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9501279","Network slicing;resource allocation;distributed machine learning;deep reinforcement learning","Training;Industries;Adaptation models;Network topology;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","26","","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This emerging TI technology, also considered as the next evolution phase of Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to create numerous opportunities for technology markets in a wide variety of applications ranging from teleoperation systems and Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to automotive safety and eHealthcare towards addressing the complex problems of human society. However, the realization of TI over wireless media in the upcoming Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond networks creates various non-conventional communication challenges and stringent requirements in terms of ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, high data-rate connectivity, resource allocation, multiple access and quality-latency-rate tradeoff. To this end, this paper aims to provide a holistic view on wireless TI along with a thorough review of the existing state-of-the-art, to identify and analyze the involved technical issues, to highlight potential solutions and to propose future research directions. First, starting with the vision of TI and recent advances and a review of related survey/overview articles, we present a generalized framework for wireless TI in the Beyond 5G Era including a TI architecture, the main technical requirements, the key application areas and potential enabling technologies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing TI works by broadly categorizing them into three main paradigms; namely, haptic communications, wireless AR/VR, and autonomous, intelligent and cooperative mobility systems. Next, potential enabling technologies across physical/Medium Access Control (MAC) and network layers are identified and discussed in detail.

This is essential to support low-latency applications and ultrahigh-reliability services. It also enables more dynamically tight interworking of 5G NR and LTE with dual connectivity, expanding initial 5G NR coverage. We analyze a lower-layer RAN split to optimize fronthaul and so further improve radio efficiency by utilizing the multitier SON among various radio nodes as well as distributed units (DUs) and centralized units (CUs).

In this paper, the structure and the protocols of NWDAF that are defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard documents are first described. Then, cell-based synthetic data set for 5G networks based on the fields defined by the 3GPP specifications is generated. Further, some anomalies are added to this data set (e.g., suddenly increasing traffic in a particular cell), and then these anomalies within each cell, subscriber category, and user equipment are classified. Afterward, three ML models, namely, linear regression, long-short term memory, and recursive neural networks are implemented to study behaviour information estimation (e.g., anomalies in the network traffic) and network load prediction capabilities of NWDAF. For the prediction of network load, three different models are used to minimize the mean absolute error, which is calculated by subtracting the actual generated data from the model prediction value. For the classification of anomalies, two ML models are used to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, namely, logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting. According to the simulation results, neural network algorithms outperform linear regression in network load prediction, whereas the tree-based gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression in anomaly detection. These estimations are expected to increase the performance of the 5G network through NWDAF.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143579","Handover;machine learning;NWDAF;5G networks","5G mobile communication;Cellular networks;3GPP;Data analysis;Machine learning;Load modeling;Data models","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;data analysis;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","intelligent network data analytics function;5G cellular networks;legacy cellular networks;NWDAF;network operators;machine learning based data analytics methodologies;3GPP specifications;ML models;linear regression;recursive neural networks;network traffic;neural network algorithms;network load prediction;tree-based gradient boosting algorithm;cell-based synthetic data set;3rd generation partnership project standard documents;long-short term memory;logistic regression;anomaly detection","","6","","","","17 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

After pointing out that optimal multicast scheduling and radio resource management problem is NP-complete, we propose two different solutions, based on dynamic programming (DP) and greedy heuristics, for minimizing the energy cost for DR customers. We also analyze the performance of SG user capacity for 5G single cell multicast and multicast broadcast single frequency network.

Besides the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, we also notice that the 5G network in itself is composed of millions of heterogeneous physical entities and nodes, multiple domains, complex protocols and technologies, different gateways, and so on. This heterogeneity imposes critical impacts on the application specific quality of service (QoS) requirements, performance and utilization of network resources, and data and user security. In order to alleviate the above impacts, researchers propose to use different technologies such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, blockchain, and artificial intelligence in 5G-enabled IoT networking. We notice that the layers over layers (of protocols and technologies) act like a plug-in over plug-in (PoP) in the network in order to accomplish various aims, including meeting QoS demands, enhancing security, load balancing, and so on. On one hand, we agree that this integration of different technologies in 5G networks bring numerous advantages, but on the other hand, we realize that this has posed a lot of unique critical issues in modern 5G network management. In this article, we point out that this straightforward approach of PoP is eventually not a healthy approach for network transformation. In this regard, using open source MANO (OSM), we provide a proof of concept (PoC) to show that at varying degrees of heterogeneity, PoP adds the delay in the VNF deployment process and further impacts the VIM CPU performance. This eventually affects the QoS requirements of IoT nodes or applications. Following this, we propose a high-level holistic approach that helps to alleviate the PoP issue. Finally, in this context, we also discuss the associated challenges and research opportunities.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318244","","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Security;Computer architecture;Heterogeneous networks;Delays;Time factors;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;blockchains;computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;Internet of Things;internetworking;protocols;public domain software;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;virtualisation","proof of concept;VNF deployment process;VIM CPU performance;open source MANO;5G network management;artificial intelligence;blockchain;application specific quality of service;PoP evaluation;QoS requirements;network transformation;QoS demands;5G-enabled IoT networking;network function virtualization;software-defined networking;user security;network resource utilization;critical impacts;gateways;complex protocols;heterogeneous physical entities;Internet of Things domain;network management infrastructure;digital transformations;telecommunication industries;heterogeneous 5G enabled networks;plug-in over plug-in evaluation","","","","15","","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The RAN slice is defined as a logical network able to provide a variety of services separately in a RAN. In adaptive RAN, an efficient slice admission control (SAC) scheme for RAN slices is required. Recently, research on applying a machine learning (ML) to facilitate efficient slice resource management and SAC in 5G RAN slicing environments has been discussed. However, the training time for the existing SAC scheme based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework (DRLF) takes too long to achieve an acceptable level of performance. Since it takes a long time to learn, it is difficult to guarantee sufficient performance in the early phase of the operating period. In this paper, we propose a SAC based on an ensemble learning method (ELM) to reduce learning time and improve performance for the adaptive RAN. Our evaluation with ELM for the improved utilization of resource blocks (RBs) shows that the proposed approach outperforms the other approaches.","","978-1-7281-7307-8","10.1109/GCWkshps50303.2020.9367536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367536","5G;Adaptive RAN;RAN Slicing;Slice Admission Control;Ensemble Learning;Reinforcement Learning","Training;5G mobile communication;Admission control;Reinforcement learning;Resource management;Reliability;Radio access networks","5G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability","communication services;advanced 5G system;RAN slice;adaptive RAN;machine learning;efficient slice resource management;future 5G system;performance targets;high reliability;adaptive radio access network system;ensemble learning method-based slice admission control scheme;logical network;SAC scheme;5G RAN slicing environments;deep reinforcement learning framework;DRLF;ELM;resource blocks","","","","18","","5 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their deployments require very fast communication channels, which can be facilitated by 5G networks. However, 5G's ultra-densification boost system capacity and spectrum efficiency but introduce vulnerabilities due to the incorporation of many wireless network technologies and devices. The conventional 5G handover authentication protocols have security challenges that expose them to attacks such as message replay. As such, many authentication protocols have been proposed to secure smart grid data transmission. However, these protocols are unreliable in attacks detection and prevention, energy inefficient, have high latencies, heavy communication as well as computational overheads. In this paper, a 5G key management and handover protocol is developed to address some of these security and performance issues. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol preserves perfect forward key secrecy, is robust against de-synchronization, replay, man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of services (DoS) and jamming attacks. Performance analysis showed that it has low communication overheads, space complexity and handover authentication latencies.

Proactive network optimisation is widely acknowledged as one of the most promising ways to transform the 5G network based on big data analysis and cloud-fog-edge computing, but there are many challenges. Proactive algorithms will require accurate forecasting of highly contextualised traffic demand and quantifying the uncertainty to drive decision making with performance guarantees. Context in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) is often challenging to uncover, unfolds over time, and even more difficult to quantify and integrate into decision making. The first part of the review focuses on mining and inferring CPSS context from heterogeneous data sources, such as online user-generated-content. It will examine the state-of-the-art methods currently employed to infer location, social behaviour, and traffic demand through a cloud-edge computing framework; combining them to form the input to proactive algorithms. The second part of the review focuses on exploiting and integrating the demand knowledge for a range of proactive optimisation techniques, including the key aspects of load balancing, mobile edge caching, and interference management. In both parts, appropriate state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (including probabilistic uncertainty cascades in proactive optimisation), complexity-performance trade-offs, and demonstrative examples are presented to inspire readers.

In addition, 6G adopts an average of 1000+ massive number of connections per person in one decade (2030 virtually instantaneously).

The work carried out in this paper aims to highlight improvements to the multi-level architecture by enabling artificial intelligence (AI) in URLLC providing a new technique in designing wireless networks. This is done through the application of learning, predicting, and decision-making to manage the stream of individuals trained by big data. The secondary aim of this research paper is to improve a multi-level architecture. This enables user level for device intelligence, cell level for edge intelligence, and cloud intelligence for URLLC. The improvement mainly depends on using the training process in unsupervised learning by developing data-driven resource management. In addition, improving a multi-level architecture for URLLC through deep learning (DL) would facilitate the creation of a data-driven AI system, 6G networks for intelligent devices, and technologies based on an effective learning capability.

Indeed, 3GPP is devising a new architecture for the core network, which replaces point-to-point interfaces used in 3G and 4G by producer/consumer-based communication among 5G core network functions, facilitating deployment over a virtual infrastructure. One big advantage of using VNFs is the possibility of dynamic scaling, depending on traffic load (i.e., instantiate new resources to VNFs when the traffic load increases and reduce the number of resources when the traffic load decreases). In this article, we propose a novel mechanism to scale 5G core network resources by anticipating traffic load changes through forecasting via ML techniques. The traffic load forecast is achieved by using and training a neural network on a real dataset of traffic arrival in a mobile network. Two techniques were used and compared: RNN, more specifically LSTM; and DNN. Simulation results show that the forecast-based scalability mechanism outperforms the threshold-based solutions, in terms of latency to react to traffic change, and delay to have new resources ready to be used by the VNF to react to traffic increase.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2018.1800104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8553653","","5G mobile communication;Scalability;3GPP;Telecommunication traffic;Cloud computing;Networked control systems;Delays;Traffic control;Load management;Software defined networking;Smart devices;Dynamic scheduling","5G mobile communication;forecasting theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;recurrent neural nets;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","functional networking entities;point-to-point interfaces;traffic load changes;traffic load forecast;neural network;traffic arrival;mobile network;forecast-based scalability mechanism;traffic change;traffic forecasting;network connectivity;VNF;5G core network scalability;machine learning approach;IoT;NFV;SDN;3GPP;5G core network functions;5G core network resources","","38","","21","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Considering the bandwidth and resource requirements of different services, such as unicast and multicast services of multimedia TV broadcasting, rationally allocating resources while providing high-quality services and realizing green energy savings of base stations is one of the challenges. This paper is aimed at the resource allocation for TV multimedia service in the 5G wireless cloud network (C-RAN) scenario, which can support unicast services for cellular users and multicast services for broadcast services simultaneously, and it proposes the corresponding slice resources allocation architecture based on the concept of a self-organizing network. The management architecture first builds the functions and processes of the corresponding autonomous resource management. Based on the multidimensional data, an effective deep learning model named LSTM (long short-term memory) is used to construct the dynamic traffic model of the multicast service in space-time, which provides a basis for further network resource allocation. Based on the prediction results and the condition of satisfying the changing requirements of users, the corresponding optimization model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the energy usage of the RRHs (remote radio heads) and taking the QoS constraints of the users into account. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework combined with a convex optimization method are then used to complete the users' bandwidth and power resource allocation.

Network slicing is promoted by 3GPP and provides a logical vertical partition of the network that is based on network virtualization technologies, namely, network function virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN) and ETSI multi-access edge computing (MEC). Despite the undisputed benefits in terms of flexibility and scalability that are pledged by the paradigm, network slicing requires intelligent resource scheduling and allocation algorithms to efficiently use the network resources, especially at the edge of the network, due to their scarcity. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for steering data traffic of multiple slices in the edge backhaul network, which aims at maximizing the QoS.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are two of the key enabler technologies in 5G networks that can be used to optimize the allocation of the network resources and guarantee the diverse requirements of IoV applications. As traditional model-based optimization techniques generally end up with NP-hard and strongly non-convex and nonlinear mathematical programming formulations, in this article, we introduce a model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the resource allocation problem in MEC-enabled IoV networks based on network slicing. Furthermore, the solution uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enable better exploitation of the scarce channel resources. The considered problem addresses jointly the channel and power allocation, the slice selection, and the vehicle selection (vehicle grouping). We model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then we solve it using DRL with the well-known deep Q learning (DQL) algorithm.

However, the acquisition of transmitter side CSI entails many challenges. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted CSI estimation technique in highly mobile vehicular networks, based on the fact that the propagation environment (scatterers, reflectors) is almost identical thereby allowing a data driven deep neural network (DNN) to learn the non-linear CSI relations with negligible overhead. Moreover, we formulate and solve a dynamic network slicing based resource allocation problem for vehicular user equipments (VUEs) requesting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC) traffic slices. The formulation considers a threshold rate violation probability minimization for the eMBB slice while satisfying a probabilistic threshold rate criterion for the URLLC slice.

However, the introduction of network slicing into radio access networks (RAN) can greatly increase user handover complexity in cellular networks. Specifically, both physical resource constraints on base stations (BSs) and logical connection constraints on network slices (NSs) should be considered when making a handover decision. Moreover, various service types call for an intelligent handover scheme to guarantee the diversified QoS requirements. As such, in this article, a multiagent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handover Scheme, named LESS, is proposed, with the purpose of minimizing handover cost while maintaining user QoS. Due to the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity caused by user mobility, conventional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot be applied directly. To solve these difficulties, LESS exploits the unique characteristics of slicing in designing two algorithms: 1) LESS-DL, a distributed Q-learning algorithm to make handover decisions with reduced action space but without compromising handover performance; 2) LESS-QVU, a modified Q-value update algorithm which exploits slice traffic similarity to improve the accuracy of Q-value evaluation with limited data. Thus, LESS uses LESS-DL to choose the target BS and NS when a handover occurs, while Q-values are updated by using LESS-QVU. The convergence of LESS is theoretically proved in this article. Simulation results show that LESS can significantly improve network performance. In more detail, the number of handovers, handover cost and outage probability are reduced by around 50%, 65%, and 45%, respectively, when compared with traditional methods.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3031079","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971099); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663476); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S02476X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223714","Handover;RAN slicing;multi-agent reinforcement learning;quality of service","Handover;Quality of service;Network slicing;Radio access networks;Cellular networks","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);multi-agent systems;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","cellular networks;handover decision;multiagent reinforcement learning;smart handover scheme;QoS;reinforcement learning algorithms;distributed Q-learning algorithm;modified Q-value update algorithm;handover mechanism;radio access network slicing;mobile networks;slice traffic","","3","","31","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we first propose a novel system model that enables the network provider to effectively slice various types of resources to different classes of users under separate virtual slices.

To obtain the optimal resource allocation policy under the dynamics of slicing requests, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning algorithm is often adopted in the literature. However, such an algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence, especially for problems with large state/action spaces. This makes Q-learning practically inapplicable to our case, in which multiple resources are simultaneously optimized. To tackle it, we propose a novel network slicing approach with an advanced deep learning architecture, called deep dueling, that attains the optimal average reward much faster than the conventional Q-learning algorithm. This property is especially desirable to cope with the real-time resource requests and the dynamic demands of the users. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework yields up to 40% higher long-term average return while being few thousand times faster, compared with the state-of-the-art network slicing approaches.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666109","Network slicing;MDP;Q-learning;deep reinforcement learning;deep dueling;resource allocation","Network slicing;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;optimisation;resource allocation;virtualisation","deep dueling neural networks;network resource requests;combinatorial optimization;resource demands;semiMarkov decision process;optimal resource allocation policy;uncertain service time;optimal average reward;real-time resource requests;network provider;virtual slices;Q-learning algorithm;optimal resource slicing framework;network slicing approach;deep learning architecture","","26","","49","IEEE","12 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, technologies, such as multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network slicing provide another opportunity for the IoT to support more advanced and real-time services that could not have been previously supported. However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take the full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node, where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conducted an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides twice as much transmission speed as that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3052498","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Fast Intelligence Analysis HW/SW Engine Exploiting IoT Platform for Boosting On-device AI in 5G Environment)(grant numbers:2020-0-00959); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328448","Internet of Things (IoT);multiaccess edge computing (MEC);network slicing;oneM2M standard;virtualization","Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Network slicing;Computer architecture;Edge computing;5G mobile communication","","","","","","72","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied.

In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation.

The smart grid concept relies on the integration of high-speed and reliable communication networking technologies in order to provide twofold benefits - one for the interconnection between the existing power grid and intelligent information systems, and another for enabling real-time grid monitoring via IoT devices. However, the security of IoT devices themselves is a challenge due to the trade-off between device cost and secure communication requirements. Further, current electricity grids require robust and secure wireless communication infrastructure to realize transformation to smart grids. The 5G networks are considered as an enabler for digitalization of power grids and facilitating IoT connectivity for future smart grids with several benefits such as low latency, ultra high speed, and improved reliability. However, the use of public 5G networks may introduce new types of security risks to the IoT-based smart grids infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the security aspects of 5G security specifications released by the 3GPP standards organization from the perspective of IoT-based smart grids. In particular, we consider a smart grid scenario utilizing 5G as a wireless communication infrastructure, and present 5G benefits to several security aspects such as authentication, confidentially, integrity, resiliency, and availability. Further, we outline security risks to IoT-based smart grids originating from compromised 5G network-related infrastructure.","","978-1-7281-3345-4","10.1109/SA47457.2019.8938064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938064","","5G mobile communication;Smart grids;Security;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Reliability;Wireless sensor networks","3G mobile communication;Internet of Things;power system management;power system reliability;power system security;SCADA systems;smart power grids","power system;operational power grid assets;reliable communication networking technologies;real-time grid monitoring;IoT devices;electricity grids;wireless communication infrastructure;power grids;future smart grids;public 5G networks;security risks;IoT-based smart grids infrastructure;5G network-related infrastructure;SCADA;supervisory control and data acquisition;3GPP standards organization;intelligent information systems","","","","43","","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The neutral host model is key for this vertical, specially to promote the infrastructure sharing between operators for a pervasive infrastructure deployment. However, it demands enhancements in today's virtualization technologies to support geographically scattered and resource constrained computing and networking elements (i.e., core data centers, edge computing point of presences, and far-edge servers at lampposts, etc.). This paper presents the virtualization enhancements developed within the H2020 5GCity project to support the neutral host model for smart city deployments. The envisioned virtualization technology demands security and technology extensions with a unified view of sliceable and heterogeneous devices and radio technologies (e.g., LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi). In our solution, security is enhanced by deploying a robust compute node authentication, monitoring, and geo-tagging. In addition, wireless connectivity is extended via an innovative multiple RAN controller approach for the management and control of heterogeneous radio resources. In order to be validated, our virtualization approach is being deployed and demonstrated in the cities of Bristol, Barcelona, and Lucca.","","978-1-7281-3627-1","10.1109/5GWF.2019.8911726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911726","","Virtualization;5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Security;Computer architecture;Smart cities","cellular radio;cloud computing;computer network security;IP networks;mobile computing;radio access networks;resource allocation;ubiquitous computing;virtualisation;wireless LAN","heterogeneous devices;radio technologies;robust compute node authentication;heterogeneous radio resources;virtualization approach;network virtualization;smart cities;important 5G verticals;neutral host model;pervasive infrastructure deployment;virtualization technology;resource constrained computing;networking elements;core data centers;far-edge servers;virtualization enhancements;H2020 5GCity project;smart city deployments;technology extensions","","","","28","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide individuals and companies with a real-time, social, and all connected experience, an end-to-end coordinated architecture which is agile and intelligent has to be designed at each stage. As FPGA has the potential to be resource/power efficient, it can be used for building up constituents of 5G infrastructure.

As ICT developments continue, it is expected that the technology advancements will be able to fulfill the sophisticated requirements for vehicular use cases, such as: low latency and reliable communications for safety; increased computing power to process large amounts of sensed data; and increased bandwidth for onboard infotainment. The aforementioned requirements have received significant focus during the ongoing definition of the 3GPP 5G mobile standards, where there has been a drive to facilitate vertical segments such as automotive, in addition to providing the core aspects of the communication infrastructure. Among the technology enablers for 5G, multi-access edge computing (MEC) can be considered essential. That is, a cloud environment located at the edge of the network, in proximity of the end users and coupled with the service provider's network infrastructure. Even before 5G is rolled out, current mobile networks can already target support for these challenging use cases using MEC technology. This is because MEC is able to fulfill low latency and high bandwidth requirements, and, in addition, lends itself to be deployed at vertical industrial sector premises such as road infrastructure, air/seaports, and smart factories, thus bringing computing power where it is needed most. This work showcases the automotive use cases that are relevant for MEC, providing insights into the technologies specified and investigated by the ETSI Industry Specification Group MEC, who were the pioneers in creating a standardized computing platform for advanced mobile networks with regard to network edge related use cases.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.2018.1800013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515152","","Automotive engineering;5G mobile communication;Vehicle ad hoc networks;Intelligent vehicles;Cloud computing;Edge computing","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;distributed processing;Internet;investment;multi-access systems;road safety","3GPP 5G mobile standards;vertical segments;communication infrastructure;technology enablers;service provider;MEC technology;high bandwidth requirements;ETSI Industry Specification Group MEC;standardized computing platform;advanced mobile networks;automotive industries;investment;vertical industrial sector;telco industries;information and communication technology;cloud environment;service provider network infrastructure;onboard infotainment;technology advancements;ICT developments;digital transformation;connected car market;5G-connected cars;multiaccess edge computing","","27","","15","","30 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

V2X communication refers to the exchange of information between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I) or between vehicles (V2V). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for the next generation of connected devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Following this idea, we propose a network slicing based communication model for vehicular networks. In this paper, we have modelled a multi-lane highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic requirements. Autonomous driving slice (exchanges safety messages) and infotainment slice (provides video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. In addition, a relaying approach is utilized to improve the performance of low signal-to-interferenceplus- noise-ratio (SINR) video streaming vehicles. These low SINR vehicles are served by other infotainment vehicles, which have high quality V2V and V2I link and are not serving as autonomous driving slice access point. An extensive Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) system level simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in which it is shown that the proposed network slicing approach increases the packet reception ratio (PRR) from 31.15% to 99.47%.","","978-3-8007-4560-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8385521","","","","","","3","","","","14 Jun 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In this context, we propose a new resource allocation for the future Industry 4.0 based on software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies, machine learning tools and the slicing paradigm where each slice of the network is dedicated to a category of services having similar QoS requirement level. In this article, the proposed solution ensures the allocation of the resources to the slices depending on their requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, and reliability. Toward this goal, our solution is performed in three main steps: first, Internet of Things (IoT) devices assignment to the slices step based on online Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm, second, inter-slices resources reservations step based on mini-batch gradient descent, and third, intra-slices resources allocations based on the max-utility algorithm. We have performed extensive simulations in a realistic industrial scenario using NS3 simulator.

Using these novel technologies to support a wide array of use cases, brings in a new set of challenges in providing security and privacy. It is therefore imperative to conduct rigorous cybersecurity analysis on different aspects of the network. In this paper, we propose a security testbed for next-generation mobile networks, which will allow us to conduct various security analyses that are transparent and easy to replicate.

In this article, we discuss to use both linear and non-linear forecasting methods, including machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to improve 5G networks’ management. For this purpose, we design and implement a real-time distributed forecasting framework, used to make simultaneous predictions of different network performance metrics, and with different learning algorithms. By using our framework, we compare the use of forecasting methods in two network scenarios, in a real vehicular network and in a 4G network, representing two different slices in a 5G network. We also integrate our framework in a 5G architecture. Using the best forecasting models assessed previously, we propose a dynamic threshold algorithm for multi-slice management, to ensure that the resources of each slice are updated according to the slices’ needs, while avoiding congestion and saving resources for other slices.

To develop these strategies, we analyze value networks for the provision of connectivity and data services in the city context. We identify four value network configurations that can successfully operate the 5G light pole network by providing connectivity services. However, the recovery of investments may take a long time, given the high costs of civil works. To increase the attractiveness of investments, we also identify multiple VNCs that can generate complementary revenues from the exploitation of city data, reducing the payback time.

To address these problems, technologies including space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), machine learning, edge computing, and energy harvesting are highly expected in 6G IoT. In this article, we consider the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites to offer wireless-powered IoT devices edge computing and cloud computing services, respectively. To accelerate the communications, Terahertz frequency bands are utilized for communications between UAVs and IoT devices. Since the tasks generated by terrestrial IoT devices can be conducted locally, offloaded to the UAV-based edge servers or remote cloud servers through satellites, we focus on the computation offloading problem and consider deep learning techniques to optimize the task success rate considering the energy dynamics and channel conditions. A deep-learning-based offloading policy optimization strategy is given where the long short-term memory model is considered to address the dynamics of energy harvesting performance.

The Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol has been proposed to achieve this goal as it allows to transfer time-critical information within a few milliseconds. However, the transmission of GOOSE messages is often limited to a small Local Area Network (LAN). An earlier work has proposed to use the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) as a means to transport IP-based GOOSE messages in a large-scale smart grid environment. On the basis of this work, this paper designs and implements an alternative solution for Ethernet-based GOOSE communication over a virtualized 5G core network that does not require any modification of the existing network protocol stack and thus is much easier to deploy. Our experimental results show that the delay introduced by the core network is in the order of sub milliseconds, while the one-way delay without a real radio access network, and without background traffic, is less than 1 ms. Moreover, these delays can be significantly reduced with a container-based deployment rather than a virtual machine-based one. Assuming a 1-ms delay budget for a 5G radio access network, our evaluation confirms that it is indeed feasible to use 5G for GOOSE transmission in IEC 61850 substation automation systems.","2573-7562","978-1-7281-1035-6","10.1109/MobileCloud48802.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126750","5G-Core;Virtualization;Low-Latency;Smart-Grid;Container;GOOSE","","5G mobile communication;IEC standards;protocols;radio access networks;smart power grids;substation automation;virtual machines;wireless LAN","IEC 61850 substation automation systems;GOOSE transmission;delay budget;virtual machine-based;container-based deployment;radio access network;sub milliseconds;existing network protocol stack;core network;Ethernet-based GOOSE communication;large-scale smart grid environment;IP-based GOOSE messages;mobile networks;Local Area Network;time-critical information;Generic Object Oriented Substation Event protocol;distantly located substations;real-time communication requirements;time critical communication;virtualized 5G core","","1","","32","","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As machine learning (ML) is expected to play a pivotal role in the efficient control and management of these networks, in this work, we examine the ML-based quality-of-transmission (QoT) estimation problem under the dynamic network slicing context, where each slice has to meet a different QoT requirement. Specifically, we examine ML-based QoT frameworks with the aim of finding QoT model/s that are fine-tuned according to the diverse QoT requirements. Centralized and distributed frameworks are examined and compared according to their model accuracy, routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) accuracy, and CPU (training time) and RAM (memory) requirements. We show that the distributed QoT models outperform the centralized QoT model in accuracy and CPU usage. The RSA accuracy, i.e., measuring the accuracy of the models with regard to the QoT-aware RSA decisions, is sufficiently high for both frameworks. Regarding the RAM usage, as the distributed framework has to train in parallel several QoT models, it may require higher memory, especially as the number of diverse QoT requirements increases. This memory, however, tends to be reserved for a shorter period of time. Moreover, this work develops a dynamic multi-slice QoT-aware (RSA) framework that integrates the ML-based QoT models. The aim is to examine the network performance when the diverse QoT models are considered, as opposed to the state-of-the-art single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach where all connections/slices are provisioned according to a single QoT requirement. We show that the multi-slice QoT-aware RSA approach significantly improves network performance, a clear indicator that the commonly considered single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach may lead to connection overprovisioning.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.387853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067831","","Estimation;Network slicing;Optical fiber networks;Solid modeling;Training;Random access memory","learning (artificial intelligence);optical fibre networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","decentralizing machine-learning-based QoT estimation;sliceable optical networks;machine learning;ML-based quality-of-transmission estimation problem;dynamic network slicing context;ML-based QoT frameworks;distributed frameworks;model accuracy;RAM requirements;distributed QoT models;centralized QoT model;RSA accuracy;QoT-aware RSA decisions;distributed framework;parallel several QoT models;multislice QoT-aware framework;ML-based QoT models;network performance;diverse QoT models;single QoT requirement;multislice QoT-aware RSA;single-slice QoT-aware RSA approach;diverse QoT requirements;5G diverse use cases","","3","","","","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is envisioned that more advanced radio transmission, resource allocation, and networking techniques are required to be developed. Fulfilling these tasks is challenging since network infrastructure becomes increasingly complicated and heterogeneous. One promising solution is to leverage the great potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which has been explored to provide solutions ranging from channel prediction to autonomous network management, as well as network security. As of today, however, the state of the art of integrating AI into wireless networks is mainly limited to use a dedicated AI algorithm to tackle a specific problem. A unified framework that can make full use of AI capability to solve a wide variety of network problems is still an open issue. Hence, this paper will present the concept of intelligence slicing where an AI module is instantiated and deployed on demand. Intelligence slices are applied to conduct different intelligent tasks with the flexibility of accommodating arbitrary AI algorithms. Two example slices, i.e., neural network based channel prediction and anomaly detection based industrial network security, are illustrated to demonstrate this framework.","2473-3644","978-3-903176-18-8","10.23919/WMNC.2019.8881402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8881402","","Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Security;MIMO communication;5G mobile communication;Prediction algorithms;Transmitting antennas","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","5g networks;fifth-generation networks;mobile networks;advanced radio transmission;resource allocation;networking techniques;network infrastructure;Artificial Intelligence technology;channel prediction;autonomous network management;wireless networks;AI module;Intelligence slices;AI algorithms;neural network;industrial network security","","1","","26","","24 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee performance isolation while maximizing network resource utilization under traffic uncertainty, network slice needs to be reconfigured adaptively. However, it is commonly believed that the fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem is intractable due to the extremely high computational complexity caused by the numerous variables. In this paper, we investigate network slice reconfiguration with aim of minimizing long-term resource consumption by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address the curse of dimensionality of the problem, we propose to incorporate the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) into DRL, to avoid some unnecessary calculations of Q-value by separating the Q-network into a shared value branch and a number of distributed advantage branches. Furthermore, the value branch and the advantage branch of each dimension are aggregated to derive the corresponding dimension's sub-Q-value. Then the best reconfiguration action is composed of the subactions in individual dimensions which are selected by €-greedy policy. Finally, we design an intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy based on BDQ and extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed slice reconfiguration policy.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148848","","Resource management;Substrates;Bandwidth;Numerical models;Machine learning;Quality of service;Network slicing","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","deep reinforcement learning;branching dueling q-network;connectivity services;diverse usage scenarios;network slicing;dynamic network slice reconfiguration;intelligent online network slice reconfiguration policy;reconfiguration action;advantage branch;distributed advantage branches;shared value branch;DRL;long-term resource consumption;extremely high computational complexity;fine-grained resource reconfiguration problem;network resource utilization","","1","","13","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, managing RAN resources and sharing them among network slices is an increasingly difficult task, which needs to be properly designed. The goal is to improve network performance and introduce flexibility and greater utilization of network resources by accurately and dynamically provisioning the activated network slices with the appropriate amounts of resources to meet their diverse requirements. In this paper, we propose a data-driven RAN slicing mechanism based on a resource sharing algorithm running at the Slice Orchestrator (SO) level. This algorithm computes the necessary radio resources to be used by each deployed network slice. These resources are adjusted periodically based on current estimates of achievable throughput performance derived from channel quality information, and in particular from the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values of the users of each network slice retrieved from the RAN. CQI information is reported to base stations by the User Equipment (UE) following standard procedures, but extracting and frequently reporting it from base stations to the SO may result in significant communication overhead. To mitigate this overhead while maintaining at the SO level an accurate view of UE channel qualities, we propose a machine learning approach to infer the stability of UE channel conditions, as well as predictive schemes to reduce the CQI reporting intensity based on the inferred channel status. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of our data-driven RAN slicing framework, which allows to meet the stringent requirements of two main classes of network slices in 5G, i.e., enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3098193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490293","Network slicing;radio resource sharing;RAN monitoring;CQI;machine learning.","Resource management;Monitoring;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Base stations;5G mobile communication;Channel estimation;Radio access networks","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Splitting the network into slices which have different properties (e.g., bandwidth requirements, delay tolerance, user density, etc.) allows to schedule and optimize the requests under the constraint of limited resources. The network has to decide to accept or reject the requests, and scale up/down the slices by considering the user density in accepted requests, and then, schedule the accepted requests to serve them in an order. In this paper, it is verified that slicing the network and scaling up/down the slices by using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms with consideration of user density, improve the speed of satisfaction of users with respect to the classical baseline scheduling algorithms.","","978-1-7281-7127-2","10.1109/BlackSeaCom48709.2020.9235006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9235006","resource management;next generation networks;dynamic scheduling;network slicing;reinforcement learning","Bandwidth;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Delays;Quality of service;Heuristic algorithms;Gaussian distribution;Throughput","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;next generation networks;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","dynamic resource management;next generation networks;dense user traffic;fifth generation networks;mobile service users;quality of service requirements;heterogeneous requirements;network slicing concept;5G network;deep reinforcement learning algorithms;DRL algorithms;classical baseline scheduling algorithm","","","","12","","27 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, proliferation in the artificial intelligence (AI)-based sixth-generation (6G) technology for achieving the smart automation system has caught the attention of both academia and industry. Most of the intelligent automation systems are formed by IoT-based user terminal (UT) devices for multimedia (i.e., video, audio, image, and text) content delivery with high clarity and efficiency. Customer satisfaction/perception, i.e., Quality of Experience (QoE), is an essential factor to be analyzed because the Quality of Service (QoS) is not a suitable candidate to portray the feelings and expectations of users during multimedia transmission. Therefore, the energy-efficient, entropy-aware communication, and QoE analysis through IoT devices are the dire need. This article focuses on how the energy-efficient communication and user’s QoE level can be captured through the UT device during multimedia transmission. Thus first, QoS-based joint energy and entropy optimization (QJEEO) algorithm is proposed. Second, the 6G-driven multimedia data structure model and framework are developed for modeling and evaluation of QoE with acquisition time. Third, the relationship between subjective test score (i.e., surveyed data) and objective performance metrics with mobility/speed of IoT-based devices for multimedia service is established. Fourth, the correlation model is proposed for integrating QoS parameters with estimated QoE perceptions. The experimental results indicate that QoE is modeled and evaluated with acquisition time and correlated with QoS parameter, i.e., packet loss ratio (PLR), and average transfer delay during energy-efficient multimedia transmission in 6G-based networks to improve the satisfaction level of customers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024715","CAS President’s International Fellowship Initiative Project China(grant numbers:2020VBC0002); Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur, Pakistan; BNU Startup Research Fund; UIC Startup Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200376","Energy-efficient framework;IoT;sixth generation (6G);smart automation;user terminal (UT) devices","Quality of experience;Automation;Quality of service;Energy efficiency;Multimedia systems;Optimization;Entropy","","","","2","","28","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA. To evaluate the proposed scheduler, we consider a dynamic policy.

However, simply utilizing network slicing and MEC is insufficient when providing a specific IoT service. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of arranging and operating common service functions (CSFs) used in the IoT platform at the edge of the network. In addition, it is necessary not only to deliver virtual CSFs but also to implement autoscaling policies of these virtual common service resources. This study extends the idea of resource slicing technologies for the IoT service layer. The IoT service layer exposes the virtual IoT CSFs as an IoT slice service to be provided in the form of virtual network functions (VNFs) with MEC applications on top of the network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) at the edge of the network.

These two extreme services are envisaged to agglomerate together into critical mMTC shortly with emerging use cases (e.g., wide-area disaster monitoring, wireless factory automation), creating new challenges to designing wireless systems beyond 5G. While conventional network slicing is effective in supporting a simple mixture of mMTC and URLLC, it is difficult to simultaneously guarantee the reliability, latency, and scalability requirements of critical mMTC (e.g., ¡ 4ms latency, 10<sup>6</sup> devices/km<sup>2</sup> for factory automation) with limited radio resources. Furthermore, recently proposed solutions to scalable URLLC (e.g., machine learning aided URLLC for driverless vehicles) are ill-suited to critical mMTC whose machine type users have minimal energy budget and computing capability that should be (tightly) optimized for given tasks. To this end, our paper aims to characterize promising use cases of critical mMTC and search for their possible solutions.

Considering the dense deployment of small cells and the existence of heterogeneous cells, an MTC device can discover multiple cells for association. Under traditional cell association mechanisms, MTC devices are typically associated with an eNodeB with highest signal strength. However, the selected eNodeB may not be able to handle mMTC requests due to network congestion and overload. Therefore, reliable cell association would provide a smarter solution to facilitate mMTC connections. To enable such a solution, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based machine learning (ML) technique is proposed in this paper to perform optimal cell association. As such, we consider MTC devices with network-assisted decision-making capabilities for selecting the most appropriate eNodeB for data transmission. The proposed HMM based ML technique focuses mainly on the reliability and availability of network resources. Correspondingly, two schemes are developed based on the classical reliability function and the next probable state of the HMM. Based on simulations under various configurations, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed schemes over a random cell selection scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761913","","Hidden Markov models;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Machine learning;5G mobile communication;Reliability;Performance evaluation","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;telecommunication computing","HMM;random cell selection scheme;mMTC device cell association;massive machine-type communication;dense deployment;heterogeneous cells;MTC device;network congestion;mMTC connections;hidden Markov model based machine learning technique;network-assisted decision-making capabilities;eNodeB;signal strength;cell association mechanisms;5G networks","","1","","15","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows the network to support the diverse requirements of different IoT verticals ranging from connected vehicles to smart agriculture. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network slice assignment scheme for software-defined IoT networks, where each application type is assigned to a distinct slice controller depending on its QoS requirements. We formulate the optimal mapping between network slices and slice controllers as an integer programming problem, and show that the proposed scheme is capable of significantly reducing the number of QoS violations compared to existing controller mapping schemes. Further, we present a scheduling scheme to dynamically re-compute the optimal mapping, based on optimal stopping theory, while taking into consideration the temporal variations in traffic and link latencies. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling strategy is able to reduce the number and expected cost of re-computations, while remaining within the QoS violation tolerance limit.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322271","University Grants Commission(grant numbers:184-17/2017(IC)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322271","Internet of Things;Network Slicing;Software-Defined Networking","Control systems;Internet of Things;Delays;Network slicing;Quality of service;Virtualization;Time factors","computer network management;integer programming;Internet of Things;quality of service;software defined networking;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","integer programming problem;quality-of-service;logically independent networks;single physical network;Internet of Things applications;software-defined networking;network slicing;software-defined IoT networks;dynamic network slice assignment scheme","","","","17","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, enforcing the security aspect of a 5G-based smart healthcare system that hosts critical data and services is becoming more urgent and critical. Passive security mechanisms (e.g., data encryption and isolation) used in legacy medical platforms cannot provide sufficient protection for a healthcare system that is deployed in a distributed manner and fail to meet the need for data/service sharing across “cloud-edge-terminal” in the 5G era. In this article, we propose a security awareness and protection system that leverages zero-trust architecture for a 5G-based smart medical platform. Driven by the four key dimensions of 5G smart healthcare including “subject” (i.e., users, terminals, and applications), “object” (i.e., data, platforms, and services), “behavior,” and “environment,” our system constructs trustable dynamic access control models and achieves real-time network security situational awareness, continuous identity authentication, analysis of access behavior, and fine-grained access control. The proposed security system is implemented and tested thoroughly at industrial-grade, which proves that it satisfies the needs of active defense and end-to-end security enforcement of data, users, and services involved in a 5G-based smart medical system.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3041042","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0909900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71673254); Innovation Research Team of Higher Education in Henan Province(grant numbers:20IRTSTHN028); Zhengzhou Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2020YJGG0003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273056","5G;security and privacy;smart healthcare;zero-trust architecture (ZTA)","5G mobile communication;Security;Medical services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Biomedical equipment;Industries;Hospitals","","","","2","","35","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we consider a hierarchical offloading scenario, where vehicle tasks are allowed to execute in MEC servers, convergence servers or cloud servers. To reduce the cost of latency and energy, we optimize the communication and computation resource allocation problem. The optimization problem is converted to a Markov decision process, and deep reinforcement learning is used to tackle the resource slicing and scheduling problem.

We then analyze the exploration behavior of various state-of-the-art DRL algorithms for slice resource allocation, and compare it with the traditional 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing baselines. Finally, we propose a transfer learning-accelerated DRL-based solution for slice resource allocation.

However, user mobility’s impact on the optimal resource allocation within and between slices deserves more attention. Slices and their dedicated resources should be offered where the services are to be consumed to minimize network latency and associated overheads and costs. Different mobility patterns lead to different resource re-allocation triggers, leading eventually to slice mobility when enough resources are to be migrated. The selection of the proper triggers for resource re-allocation and related slice mobility patterns is challenging due to triggers’ multiplicity and overlapping nature. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of two Deep Reinforcement Learning based algorithms for allowing a fine-grained selection of mobility triggers that may instantiate slice and resource mobility actions. While the first proposed algorithm relies on a value-based learning method, the second one exploits a hybrid approach to optimize the action selection process. We present an enhanced ETSI Network Function Virtualization edge computing architecture that incorporates the studied mechanisms to implement service and slice migration. We evaluate the proposed methods’ efficiency in a simulated environment and compare their performance in terms of training stability, learning time, and scalability.

The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors.

Next generation network architectures need to satisfy these two requirements while connecting IoT sources producing data at massive scales to cloud resources that provide the capability to process and store this data. For this reason, realization of IoT in next generation cellular networks faces the problem of delivering cloud services over the network to things that are placed anywhere. In this study, we explain how the technologies envisioned for next generation networks can respond to the challenge of realizing IoT over a use case prepared for the IoT smart home platform called IOLITE. We start by discussing capacity requirements and focus on network densification as a promising solution method. The challenges of network densification can be overcome by integrating the technological enablers such as SDN, C-RAN, SON, and mobile edge computing. For this reason, we provide a thorough survey on the state of the art in integrating these enablers for a flexible network architecture at all network segments. Finally, we discuss how the needs of the IOLITE community use case scenario can be satisfied by implementing a service- centric abstraction layer on top of a flexible infrastructure for beyond 5G IoT applications.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600372CM","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823336","","Internet of things;Cloud computing;Energy management;Actuators;Sensors;Edge computing","5G mobile communication;actuators;cellular radio;Internet of Things;next generation networks;sensors","5G vision;IOLITE community;sensors;actuators;transmission constraints;energy constraints;data traffic;end-to-end delay;next generation network architectures;IoT sources;next generation cellular networks;IoT smart home platform;network densification;SDN;C-RAN;SON;mobile edge computing;service-centric abstraction layer;5G IoT applications","","13","","15","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Tremendous advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning make it possible to analyze a vast volume of the field and production data and translate them into optimization decisions. Real-time access to the data complements efficient machine learning inference for timely and actionable insights. Flexible and re-configurable manufacturing also demands high-performance, pervasive, and low-la-tency communication links supporting mobility of workers, devices, and robots. Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) introduced basic support for Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication (urLLC) in Release-15 through intrinsic design features. Release-16 extends real-time capabilities of 5G NR to different verticals, addressing use cases in factory automation, the transport industry, and electrical power distribution. Wireless technologies such as 5G urLLC should co-exist with incumbent and emerging industrial Ethernet systems such as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) in a heterogenous networking architecture. Hence, specification of interworking with TSN is also part of 3GPP Release-16. In this article, we discuss low-latency and high-reliability features supporting industrial automation, focusing on Release-16 design specifications. The interworking aspects with TSN and time synchronization accuracy limits are also highlighted, followed by performance evaluation of control and data traffic channels of 5G NR with respect to urLLC requirements.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.2000035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409838","","Reliability;Ultra reliable low latency communication;5G mobile communication;Job shop scheduling;Reliability engineering;Quality of service;OFDM","","","","","","14","","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, 5G slicing is attractive for infrastructure providers as long as they are able to generate revenues, while at once satisfying the tenants' competing and variable demands and coping with resources availability. This work proposes a flexible mechanism based on a multibidding scheme for 5G slice allocation. It is able to attain desirable fairness and efficiency figures in order to serve slice tenants and associated mobile users. Built on the notion of normalised Nash equilibrium, it is also provably overbookingfree even though the players' bids are oblivious to infrastructure resources constraints. Also, it is compatible with standard radio access schedulers used in modern mobile networks. Finally, a practical algorithm is proposed to drive the system to the socially-optimal operating point via an online procedure rooted on a primal-dual distributed algorithm.

This is partly due to the lowering of barriers (e.g., costs and Internet connectivity) and advances in the underlying technologies, such as smart meters, electric vehicles, and actuators. This has also resulted in significant growth in the volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value of data (i.e., the 5 Vs of big data). However, efficiently and effectively handling such big data remains challenging. One solution currently being explored in the literature (including industry) to cope with the increasing network traffic is to use conventional cloud infrastructure, but the key limitations of such an approach include long response time and high bandwidth consumption. Therefore, there have been attempts to introduce next-generation Internet of Things networks to satisfy (real-time) network service demands and guarantee quality of service, for example, by pushing computing capabilities closer to the users (e.g., edge of the network). However, computation-intensive energy analytics can be challenging to perform at the network edge by edge or fog computing devices. Hence, there have also been attempts to utilize software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) in order to improve network functionality while adding programmability and flexibility features to the network infrastructure. Specifically, NFV facilitates virtual network function (VNF) deployment and orchestration, while SDN controls them for specific use cases. However, with the rise of next-generation mobile networks (i.e., 5G), applications and services require fast and smooth operations with greater flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. In order to align with 5G and leverage potential benefits of edge computing, VNFs should possess critical processing requirements (e.g., high throughput, low latency, and minimal computation overheads). In other words, virtualization plays an important role. To date, several techniques have been introduced in order to achieve the desired objective using virtual machines (VMs) and containers in isolation. However, a hybrid approach using VMs and containers is likely to bring potential benefits for the large-scale deployment of VNFs across the heterogeneous edge and cloud platform. Thus, in this article, a novel architecture for SDN integrated with NFV, specifically for the Energy Internet ecosystem, is presented by leveraging the advantagesof edge computing. In the considered setup, the deployment of VNFs is achieved using a mix of both virtualization and containerization. Findings from our evaluation demonstrate the potential for VNF placement across a hybrid execution setup powered by VMs, as well as the benefits of using containers.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.1900602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355050","","Ecosystems;Containers;Big Data;Internet;Virtualization;Software defined networking;Edge computing","5G mobile communication;Big Data;cloud computing;computer centres;Internet;Internet of Things;quality of service;smart power grids;software defined networking;virtual machines;virtualisation","heterogeneous edge;cloud platform;virtualization;SDN-NFV-aided edge-cloud interplay;5G-envisioned Energy Internet ecosystem;Smart Grid 2.0;Internet connectivity;smart meters;electric vehicles;big data;conventional cloud infrastructure;long response time;high bandwidth consumption;network service demands;quality of service;computation-intensive energy analytics;network edge;fog computing devices;software defined networking;network functionality;flexibility features;network infrastructure;specific use cases;next-generation mobile networks;critical processing requirements;minimal computation overheads;virtual machines;network traffic;edge computing;Industrial Internet of Things;next-generation Internet of Things networks","","","","15","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To fully take advantage of these techniques, the design of spectrum slicing policies needs to account for the limited availability of the radio resources as well as the inter-numerology interference generated by slices employing different numerologies. In this context, we formulate a binary non-convex problem that maximizes the aggregate capacity of multiple network slices. The resulting spectrum allocation minimizes the inter-numerology interference under the frequent channel fluctuations characterizing the various users. To address the computational complexity of the designed objective function, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design a model-free solution computation. In detail, the trained centralized DRL agent exploits the channel fading statistic in order to provide a spectrum allocation that minimizes the inter-numerology interference. Results reveal that the proposed DRL scheme achieves performance that is comparable to the optimal one. It also outperforms a baseline scheme that statically allocate the radio resources.","2166-9589","978-1-7281-4490-0","10.1109/PIMRC48278.2020.9217107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217107","","Resource management;Interference;Fading channels;Optimization;Land mobile radio;Multiplexing;Physical layer","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;concave programming;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication computing","inter-numerology interference;network slicing;mixed-numerology schemes;5G radio access networks;spectrum slicing policies;radio resources;multiple network slices;resulting spectrum allocation;deep reinforcement learning","","","","17","","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addressed a traffic shunt system to isolate the large bandwidth services or specific traffic types requirements such as video streaming, which have large amount of data or same destinations through SDN/OpenFlow technology, and allocates virtual network slicing flexibly and dynamically, so as to increase the bandwidth utilization.","","978-1-5090-5957-7","10.1109/CITS.2017.8035281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035281","SDN;Network Slicing;FlowVisor;Network Management","Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Streaming media;Computer architecture;Hardware","5G mobile communication;broadband networks;computer network management;quality of experience;radio networks;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","network traffic shunt system;SDN network;smart devices;wireless broadband networks;OTT;5G;Internet of Things;IoT;software defined networking;network function virtualization;quality of experience;QoE;video streaming;SDN/OpenFlow technology;virtual network","","4","","23","","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2772959","King Saud University(grant numbers:RGP-228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105799","5G;big data;emotion recognition;emotion-aware healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);local binary pattern (LBP)","Medical services;Emotion recognition;Big Data;5G mobile communication;Speech;Feature extraction;Wireless sensor networks","Big Data;data analysis;emotion recognition;Internet of Things;medical image processing;patient care","data analytics;big data-oriented wireless technologies;emotional care;emotion-aware connected healthcare system;image signals;seamless emotion-aware healthcare services;edge computing;interconnected devices;IoT devices;speech signals;healthcare big data;emotion detection module","","45","","31","","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Geared with new features, they are expected to revolutionize the mobility ecosystem to empower a portfolio of new services. Meanwhile, the development of such communication capabilities, along with the development of sensory devices and the enhancement of local computing powers, have lead to an inevitable reality of massive data (e.g., identity, location, and trajectory) collection from vehicular users. Unfortunately, 5GVN are still confronted with a variety of privacy threats. Such threats are targeted at users’ data, identity, location, and trajectory.

Multi-domain orchestration has helped in simplifying infrastructural operations and enables better scaling and faster deployment of network services. However, resource provisioning considering network optimization and fulfillment of multi-constraint quality of service (QoS) is still a major concern. In this article, an architecture comprising multi-domain edge orchestration (MDEO) entrusted by blockchain designed to solve the problem of multi-constraint QoS is proposed. A dynamic end-to-end (E2E) network slicing algorithm is devised to execute at the MDEO to enable multi-tenant on-demand network infrastructure provisioning isolation and security. The algorithm first calculates an optimum network slice topology and then instantiates the involved virtual network functions. Based on multi-constraint QoS, it fulfills the E2E slice request. Blockchain is deployed to ensure trustworthiness between different telecom operators, introduce transparency and to automate the fulfillment of service-level agreements through smart contracts. In addition, an experimental simulation of the system is performed and the burst and response times of the proposed framework are analyzed using different distributions. The data in both cases demonstrates a lognormal distributed behavior.","2576-3199","","10.1109/IOTM.0001.1900089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125428","","Blockchain;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Topology","contracts;distributed processing;quality of service;telecommunication network management;virtualisation","multiconstraint quality of service;lognormal distributed behavior;infrastructural operations;multidomain edge orchestration;virtual network functions;service-level agreements;E2E slice request;optimum network slice topology;on-demand network infrastructure provisioning isolation;end-to-end network slicing algorithm;multiconstraint QoS;MDEO;network optimization;resource provisioning;network services;faster deployment;multidomain orchestration;network management layer;blockchain-enabled multidomain edge computing orchestrator","","2","","15","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Based on these innovations, multiple network slices with different requirements and objectives can share the same physical infrastructure. The techniques to efficiently allocate the available radio resources to different slices based on their requirements and their priority, also known as inter-slice radio resource management, has been the subject of many studies. The formerly proposed algorithms either assume the slices request maximum contracted data rates or they react passively as the demands arrive. This paper proposes to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to learn the pattern of the traffic demand of each network slices and predict the demands in the next decision interval. Based on the prediction of the slices' demands, a novel model for elastic inter-slice radio resource management is proposed to increase the multiplexing gain while not compromising the quality of offered connectivity services to the slices. The proposed model is evaluated using a practical scenario. The numeric results show that while the performance of the model under full demand is similar to former models, its elastic resource management enables more efficient resource allocation when the traffic demands vary over time.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-0546-8","10.1109/EuCNC.2019.8801995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8801995","","","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","elastic slice-aware radio resource management;AI-traffic prediction;network slicing;mobile networks;multiple network slices;different slices;traffic demand;elastic inter-slice radio resource management;contracted data rates;5G networks;network virtualisation;artificial intelligence approaches","","1","","13","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those sensors continuously generate data for 24 hours, which requires huge storage resources, dedicated networks for sharing with data centers, and most importantly, it makes browsing, retrieval, and event searching a difficult and time-consuming job. Video summarization (VS) is a promising direction toward a solution to these problems by analyzing the visual contents acquired from a vision sensor and prioritizing them based on events, saliency, person's appearance, and so on. However, the current VS literature still lacks focus on resource-constrained devices that can summarize data over the edge and upload it to data repositories efficiently for instant analysis. Therefore, in this article, we carry out a survey of functional VS methods to understand their pros and cons for resource-constrained devices, with the ambition to provide a compact tutorial to the community of researchers in the field. Further, we present a novel saliency-aware VS framework, incorporating 5G-enabled IoT devices, which keeps only important data, thereby saving storage resources and providing representative data for immediate exploration. Keeping privacy of data as a second priority, we intelligently encrypt the salient frames over resource-constrained devices before transmission over the 5G network. The reported experimental results show that our proposed framework has additional benefits of faster transmission (1.8~13.77 percent frames of a lengthy video are considered for transmission), reduced bandwidth, and real-time processing compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.1900514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299471","","Surveillance;Privacy;Vision sensors;Smart cities;Streaming media;VIsualization;Real-time systems;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;computer centres;cryptography;data privacy;image sensors;information retrieval;Internet of Things;smart cities;video signal processing;video surveillance","resource-constrained devices;lengthy video;5G-enabled IoT surveillance networks;vision sensor;video data;data centers;browsing event;video summarization;data repositories;IoT devices;Internet of Things-connected smart cities;retrieval event;event searching;saliency-aware VS framework;intelligent encryption;privacy preserving video transmission","","","","15","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To cope with the ever more sophisticated RRM functionalities and the growing variety of scenarios, while carrying out the prompt decisions required in 5G, this manuscript presents a lean RRM architecture that capitalizes on recent advances in the field of machine learning in combination with the large amount of data readily available in the network from measurements and system observations. The architecture consists of a learner (or a few), which learns RRM policies directly from the data gathered in the network using a single general-purpose learning framework, and a set of distributed actors, which execute RRM policies issued by the learner and repeatedly generate samples of experience. Thus, the complexity of RRM is shifted to the design of the learning framework, while the RRM algorithms derived from this framework are executed in a computationally efficient distributed manner at the radio access nodes. The potential of this approach is verified in a pair of pertinent scenarios, and future directions on applications of machine learning to RRM are discussed.

Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Network Slicing (NS) are gaining momentum not only in research but also in IT industry representing the drivers of 5G. NS is an approach to network operations allowing the partition of a physical topology into multiple independent virtual networks, called network slices (or slices). Within a single slice, a set of Service Function Chains (SFCs) is defined and the network resources, e.g. bandwidth, can be provisioned dynamically on demand according to specific Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Traditional schemes for network resources provisioning based on static policies may lead to poor resource utilization and suffer from scalability issues. In this article, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for performing dynamic SFC resources allocation in NFV-SDN enabled metro-core optical networks. RL allows to build a self-learning system able to solve highly complex problems by employing RL agents to learn policies from an evolving network environment. In particular, we build an RL system able to optimize the resources allocation of SFCs in a multi-layer network (packet over flexi-grid optical layer). The RL agent decides if and when to reconfigure the SFCs, given state of the network and historical traffic traces. Numerical simulations show significant advantages of our RL-based optimization over rule-based optimization design.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953498","European Community Metro-Haul Project(grant numbers:761727); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901169","Software-defined networking;network function virtualization;network slicing;virtual service chain;reinforcement learning;deep learning;mixed integer linear programming","Quality of service;Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Reinforcement learning;Quality of experience;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms","contracts;learning (artificial intelligence);optical fibre networks;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;virtualisation","network slicing;reinforcement learning;RL-based optimization;RL agent;flexi-grid optical layer;multilayer network;RL system;self-learning system;dynamic SFC resources allocation;network resources;service function chains;network slices;multiple independent virtual networks;network operations;network function virtualization;software defined networking;massive machine-type communications;enhanced mobile broadband;bandwidth-hungry network applications;NFV-SDN metro-core optical networks;service function chain reconfiguration","","4","","42","CCBY","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By leveraging edge computing with the 5G RAN, management of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 can be conducted efficiently. Deploying a hierarchical edge computing architecture offers several benefits such as scalability, low latency, and privacy for the data and the training model, which enables analysis of COVID-19 by a local trusted edge server. However, existing deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial drawbacks: first, the training requires a large COVID-19 dataset on various dimensions, which is difficult for any local authority to manage. Second, the DL results require ethical approval and explanations from healthcare providers and other stakeholders in order to be accepted. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that supports COVID-19 diagnosis, leveraging the low-latency, high-bandwidth features of the 5G network at the edge. Our framework employs a distributed DL paradigm where each COVID-19 edge employs its own local DL framework and uses a three-phase reconciliation with the global DL framework. The local DL model runs on edge nodes while the global DL model runs on a cloud environment. The training of a local DL model is performed with the dataset available from the edge; it is applied to the global model after receiving approval from the subject matter experts at the edge. Our framework adds semantics to existing DL models so that human domain experts on COVID-19 can gain insight and semantic visualization of the key decision-making activities that take place within the deep learning ecosystem. We have implemented a subset of various COVID-19 scenarios using distributed DL at the edge and in the cloud. The test results are promising.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136600","","COVID-19;Deep learning;Hospitals;5G mobile communication;Solid modeling;Vaccines;Image edge detection","5G mobile communication;biomedical communication;cloud computing;data privacy;decision making;diseases;epidemics;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;neural nets;patient diagnosis;telecommunication security","B5G-based tactile edge learning;5G RAN;hierarchical edge computing architecture;local trusted edge server;COVID-19 dataset;COVID-19 diagnosis;local DL model;edge nodes;global DL model;deep learning ecosystem;COVID-19 scenarios;assisted healthcare vertical;infectious diseases;epidemic diseases;data privacy;distributed DL paradigm;cloud environment;semantic visualization;decision-making activities","","14","","15","","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recently, given their vulnerability to malicious attacks, the security of C-RAN networks has attracted significant attention. Among various anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques, the most promising one is the machine learning-based intrusion detection as it learns without human assistance and adjusts actions accordingly. In this direction, many solutions have been proposed, but they show either low accuracy in terms of attack classification or they offer just a single layer of attack detection. This research focuses on deploying a multi-stage machine learning-based intrusion detection (ML-IDS) in 5G C-RAN that can detect and classify four types of jamming attacks: constant jamming, random jamming, deceptive jamming, and reactive jamming. This deployment enhances security by minimizing the false negatives in C-RAN architectures. The experimental evaluation of the proposed solution is carried out using WSN-DS (Wireless Sensor Networks DataSet), which is a dedicated wireless dataset for intrusion detection. The final classification accuracy of attacks is 94.51% with a 7.84% false negative rate.","","978-1-7281-5628-6","10.1109/ISNCC49221.2020.9297290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9297290","Cloud Radio Access Network;Jamming attacks;Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System;Multilayer Perceptron;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks DataSet","Jamming;Wireless sensor networks;Intrusion detection;Security;Communication system security;Cloud radio access networks;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;energy consumption;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radio access networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks dataSet;multistage machine;attack detection;attack classification;adjusts actions;human assistance;intrusion detection techniques;C-RAN networks;malicious attacks;centralized data processing;real-time cloud;allocating resources;energy consumption;promising future architecture;5G cloud radio access networks;kernelized support vector machine;multistage jamming attacks;C-RAN architectures;reactive jamming;deceptive jamming;random jamming;constant jamming","","","","17","","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the scheduling policy is a deterministic mapping from channel and queue states to scheduling actions, it can be optimized by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). We show that a straightforward implementation of DDPG converges slowly, has a poor quality-of-service (QoS) performance, and cannot be implemented in real-world 5G systems, which are non-stationary in general. To address these issues, we propose a theoretical DRL framework, where theoretical models from wireless communications are used to formulate a Markov decision process in DRL. To reduce the convergence time and improve the QoS of each user, we design a knowledge-assisted DDPG (K-DDPG) that exploits expert knowledge of the scheduler design problem, such as the knowledge of the QoS, the target scheduling policy, and the importance of each training sample, determined by the approximation error of the value function and the number of packet losses. Furthermore, we develop an architecture for online training and inference, where K-DDPG initializes the scheduler off-line and then fine-tunes the scheduler online to handle the mismatch between off-line simulations and non-stationary real-world systems. Simulation results show that our approach reduces the convergence time of DDPG significantly and achieves better QoS than existing schedulers (reducing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$30\% \sim 50\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> packet losses). Experimental results show that with off-line initialization, our approach achieves better initial QoS than random initialization and the online fine-tuning converges in few minutes.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3078498","Telstra Corporation Ltd., titled “Development of an open programmable scheduler for LTE networks,”; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; two Postgraduate Research Supplementary Scholarships of The University of Sydney; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award(grant numbers:DE150101704); Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship(grant numbers:FL160100032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427224","Deep reinforcement learning;wireless scheduler design;time-sensitive traffic;online implementation","5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Quality of service;Training;Computer architecture;Reinforcement learning;Delays","","","","","","44","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, network slicing is included as a key feature of the 5G architecture to allow sharing a common infrastructure among different tenants, such as mobile communication providers, vertical market players, etc. In order to provide the Radio Access Network (RAN) with network slicing capabilities, mechanisms that efficiently distribute the available capacity among the different tenants while satisfying their needs are required. For this purpose, this paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for RAN capacity sharing. It makes use of the Deep Q-Network algorithm in a way that each agent is associated to a different tenant and learns the capacity to be provided to this tenant in each cell while ensuring that the service level agreements are satisfied and that the available radio resources are efficiently used. The consideration of multiple agents contributes to a better scalability and higher learning speed in comparison to single-agent approaches. In this respect, results show that the policy learnt by the agent of one tenant can be generalised and directly applied by other agents, thus reducing the complexity of the training and making the proposed solution easily scalable, e.g. to add new tenants in the system. The proposed approach is well aligned with the on-going 3GPP standardization work and guidelines for the parametrization of the solution are provided, thus enforcing its practical applicability.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3099557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497684","RAN Slicing; Capacity Sharing;Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Deep Q-Network","Vehicular and wireless technologies","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In radio access network (RAN) slicing, due to the device-base station (BS)-NS three layer association relationship, device association (including access control and handoff management) becomes an essential yet challenging issue. With the increasing concerns on stringent data security and device privacy, exploiting local resources to solve device association problem while enforcing data security and device privacy becomes attractive. Fortunately, recently emerging federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm with data protection, provides an effective tool to address this type of issues in mobile networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient device association scheme for RAN slicing by exploiting a hybrid FL reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework, with the aim to improve network throughput while reducing handoff cost. In our proposed framework, individual smart devices train a local machine learning model based on local data and then send the model features to the serving BS/encrypted party for aggregation, so as to efficiently reduce bandwidth consumption for learning while enforcing data privacy. Specifically, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the local model on smart devices under a hybrid FL framework, where horizontal FL is employed for parameter aggregation on BS, while vertical FL is employed for NS/BS pair selection aggregation on the encrypted party. Numerical results show that the proposed HDRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and communication efficiency in comparison with some state-of-the-art solutions.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3033035","Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9237167","RAN slicing;device association;federated learning;deep reinforcement learning","Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Data security;Data privacy;Optimization;Access control","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","BS-encrypted party;data security;handoff management;5G-and-beyond systems;device association scheme;access control;layer association relationship;key architectural technology;hybrid federated deep reinforcement learning;communication efficiency;network throughput;hybrid FL framework;data privacy;smart devices;hybrid FL reinforcement learning framework;RAN slicing;mobile networks;data protection;distributed learning paradigm;device association problem;local resources;device privacy","","5","","46","IEEE","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, 5G networks need to support three typical usage scenarios, namely, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). On the one hand, UAVs can be leveraged as cost-effective aerial platforms to provide ground users with enhanced communication services by exploiting their high cruising altitude and controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space.

Micro-slices allow to provide further context discrimination thanks to network isolation, by dynamically configuring connectivity between end-devices and applications according to requirements expressed by the applications. We illustrate the use of such micro-slices in the context of an event taking place in a stadium.

Network slicing is a promising technique for supporting M2M traffic on 6G networks as there is a need to concurrently support varying Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of M2M devices. A major bottleneck for M2M traffic is the Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure, which has to be performed for all devices, which results in the same latency for all service types. Due to the event-driven simultaneous access behavior of M2M devices, this procedure can cause severe congestion. Legacy congestion control schemes such as Access Class Barring (ACB) are not adequate to handle the overload in bursty traffic scenarios, which can happen frequently in M2M communications. There is also no clear guideline to adjust ACB parameters dynamically in such situations. Here we propose a multi-rate ACB algorithm using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tune the barring rates of different service classes. Our priority-based algorithm not only reduces the congestion but also slices the RACH among different service types. Comprehensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm maximizes the RACH utilization. In the meantime, based on each service priority, it reduces the delays and increases the access probability even when the connection requests exceed the RACH capacity.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473684","Reinforcement Learning (RL);RAN Slicing;Massive Machine Type Communication;Congestion Control;Access Class Barring (ACB)","6G mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Machine-to-machine communications;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Simulation;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","11","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the requirements of 5G network such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), mMTC(massive machine type communications), and URLLC(Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication), more and more various packets are actually appearing on the network, growing need for network management techniques to handle these various packets. Especially, with steep rise of the number of application service having distinct characteristics such as IoT, VR and 4K video, it is obvious that there is a limitation to use previous general-purpose network management techniques for them. Therefore, there is a need for research and development of adaptive networking technology which classify usage and types of network packet. Several existing machine learning algorithms have been used to classify protocols of target packets and it made a good result in previous researches.

The assumption of a fixed computational capacity at the baseband unit (BBU) pools may result in underutilized or oversubscribed resources, thus affecting the overall Quality of Service (QoS). As resources are virtualized at the BBU pools, they could be dynamically instantiated according to the required computational capacity (RCC). In this paper, a new strategy for Dynamic Resource Management with Adaptive Computational capacity (DRM-AC) using machine learning (ML) techniques is proposed. Three ML algorithms have been tested to select the best predicting approach: support vector machine (SVM), time-delay neural network (TDNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). DRM-AC reduces the average of unused resources by 96 %, but there is still QoS degradation when RCC is higher than the predicted computational capacity (PCC). To further improve, two new strategies are proposed and tested in a realistic scenario: DRM-AC with pre-filtering (DRM-AC-PF) and DRM-AC with error shifting (DRM-AC-ES), reducing the average of unsatisfied resources by 98 % and 99.9 % compared to the DRM-AC, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994258","Spanish ministry of science through the project CRIN-5G(grant numbers:RTI2018-099880-B-C32); ERDF (European Regional Development Fund); UPC through COST CA15104 IRACON EU Project(grant numbers:FPI-UPC-2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091811","Adaptive resource management;C-RAN;machine-learning","Resource management;Quality of service;Machine learning;Dynamic scheduling;Forecasting;Computer architecture;Optimization","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural nets;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;support vector machines","Dynamic Resource Management;C-RAN;efficient computational resource management;5G Cloud Radio Access Network environments;power efficiency;fixed computational capacity;baseband unit pools;underutilized resources;oversubscribed resources;BBU pools;required computational capacity;time-delay neural network;predicted computational capacity;DRM-AC-PF;DRM-AC-ES;long short-term memory;support vector machine;Machine Learning Adaptive Computational capacity prediction;quality of service","","1","","29","CCBY","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we present a MANO algorithm for VNFs allowing a central unit (CU) to learn to autonomously re-configure resources (processing power and storage), deploy new VNF instances, or offload them to the cloud, depending on the network conditions, available pool of resources, and the VNF requirements, with the goal of minimizing a cost function that takes into account the economical cost as well as latency and the quality-of-service (QoS) experienced by the users. First, we formulate the stochastic resource optimization problem as a parameterized action Markov decision process (PAMDP). Then, we propose a solution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). More precisely, we present a novel RL approach, called parameterized action twin (PAT) deterministic policy gradient, which leverages an actor-critic architecture to learn to provision resources to the VNFs in an online manner. Finally, we present numerical performance results, and map them to 5G key performance indicators (KPIs).

Network slicing is a promising solution to tailor the network to match such service requests. This paper considers a system with radio access network (RAN)-only slicing, where the physical infrastructure is split into slices providing computation and communication functionalities. A limited number of channels are auctioned across scheduling slots to MUs of multiple service providers (SPs) (i.e., the tenants). Each SP behaves selfishly to maximize the expected long-term payoff from the competition with other SPs for the orchestration of channels, which provides its MUs with the opportunities to access the computation and communication slices. This problem is modelled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a SP depend on the global network dynamics as well as the joint control policy of all SPs. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we first construct an abstract stochastic game with the local conjectures of channel auction among the SPs. We then linearly decompose the per-SP Markov decision process to simplify the decision makings at a SP and derive an online scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to approach the optimal abstract control policies. Numerical experiments show significant performance gains from our scheme.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2933893","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:319759,319758,289611); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1301003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701439,61731002); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019C01002); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:18KK0279); Telecommunications Advanced Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792072","Network slicing;radio access networks;mobile-edge computing;packet scheduling;Markov decision process;deep reinforcement learning","Resource management;Vehicle-to-everything;Reliability;Safety;Fading channels;Reinforcement learning;3GPP","cellular radio;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;radio access networks;stochastic games;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling;wireless channels","multitenant cross-slice resource orchestration;cellular networks;diverse services;mobile users;MUs;common physical network infrastructure;network slicing;service requests;radio access network-only slicing;physical infrastructure;communication functionalities;multiple service providers;SPs;long-term payoff;communication slices;decision makings;global network dynamics;abstract stochastic game;channel auction;deep reinforcement learning;optimal abstract control policies;Nash equilibrium solutions","","30","","68","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reliability of communication infrastructure is a top priority for network operators. To ensure reliable network operation, new design and management techniques for reliable communications must be constantly devised to respond to the rapid network and service evolution. As a recent and relevant example, deployments of 5G communication networks will soon enter their second phase, during which the network infrastructure will require upgrades to support new Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) services with availabilities of up to 6 nines to be guaranteed jointly with extremely low latencies. Even in the still preliminary vision of 6G communication networks, reliability is posed as one of the most critical requirements, as 6G networks will represent the communication platform of our future hyper-connected society, supporting essential services as smart mobility, e-health, and immersive environments with application in remote education and working, just to name a few. Similarly, disaster resiliency in communication networks is now attracting the attention of media, government and industry as never before (consider, e.g., the worldwide network traffic deluge to support remote working during the current Coronavirus pandemic). Luckily, several new technical directions can be leveraged to provide new solutions for network reliability as: increased network reconfigurability enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN); integration/convergence of multiple technologies (optical, wireless satellite, datacenter networks); enhanced forms of data/service replication, supported by, e.g., edge computing; network slicing, used to carve highly-reliable logical partitions of network, computing and storage resources.

Precise service-wise mobile traffic forecasting becomes essential in this context, as mobile operators seek to pre-allocate resources to each slice in advance, to meet the distinct requirements of individual services. This paper attacks the problem of multi-service mobile traffic forecasting using a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) learning paradigm and convolutional long short-term memories (ConvL-STMs). The proposed architecture is designed so as to effectively extract complex spatiotemporal features of mobile network traffic and predict with high accuracy the future demands for individual services at city scale. We conduct experiments on a mobile traffic dataset collected in a large European metropolis, demonstrating that the proposed S2S-ConvLSTM can forecast the mobile traffic volume produced by tens of different services in advance of up to one hour, by just using measurements taken during the past hour. In particular, our solution achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) at antenna level that are below 13KBps, outperforming other deep learning approaches by up to 31.2%.","2639-5061","978-1-7281-1273-2","10.1109/IWMN.2019.8804984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8804984","Mobile traffic forecasting;deep learning;convolutional long short-term memory","Forecasting;Antennas;Computer architecture;Antenna measurements;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Network slicing","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","multiservice mobile traffic forecasting;sequence-to-sequence learning paradigm;network slicing;partition network infrastructure;convolutional long short-term memories;mobile network traffic volume dataset;service-wise mobile traffic forecasting;resource allocation;sequence-to-sequence learning paradigm;S2S learning paradigm;ConvL-STM;large European metropolis;mean absolute errors;MAE","","5","","22","","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such technology is the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which describes an interconnected system of vehicles and infrastructure. Coupled with recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, IoV is transformed into an intelligent transportation system (ITS). There are, however, several operational considerations that hinder the adoption of ITSs, including scalability, high availability, and data privacy. To address these challenges, federated learning, a collaborative and distributed intelligence technique, is suggested. Through an ITS case study, the ability of a federated model deployed on roadside infrastructure throughout the network to recover from faults by leveraging group intelligence while reducing recovery time and restoring acceptable system performance is highlighted. With a multitude of use cases and benefits, federated learning is a key enabler for ITS and is poised to achieve widespread implementation in 5G and beyond networks and applications.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454589","","5G mobile communication;Shape;System performance;Scalability;Machine learning;Interconnected systems;Collaborative work;Internet of Vehicles;Edge computing","","","","","","14","","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We advocate that the automated, data-driven decisions taken by orchestrators must be guided by considerations on the cost that such decisions involve for the operator. We show that such a strategy can be implemented via a deep learning architecture that forecasts capacity rather than plain traffic, thanks to a novel loss function named α-OMC.

To unite these services with partly contradicting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, Network Slicing is considered a key technology. uRLLC slices in particular are highly demanding, requiring extremely high reliability and low latency in the single-digit milliseconds range. Consequentially, the latency impact of radio resource management on the end-to-end latency is optimized in this work by using so-called Configured Grants (CGs), which aim to minimize latency-intensive scheduling requests by pre-allocating radio resources. As predicting future traffic demands and channel conditions are required to use CGs, a data-driven machine learning-based radio resource scheduler prototype is introduced and evaluated in this work based on a specifically developed 5G radio resource simulator.

Furthermore, with emerging techniques such as millimeter-wave (mmWave), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, the coupling of IIoT and 5G will advance profoundly.

Due to the inherent dynamics of network flows, fluctuated resources are required to embedding VNFs. VNF migration has become a critical issue because of the time-varying resource requirements. In this paper, we propose a real-time VNF migration algorithm based on the deep belief network (DBN) to predict future resource requirements, which resolves the problem of lacking effective prediction in the existing methods. Firstly, we propose optimizing bandwidth utilization and migration overhead simultaneously in VNF migration. Then, to model the resource utilization that evolves over time, we adopt online learning with the assistant of offline training in the prediction mechanism, and further introduce multi-task learning (MTL) in our deep architecture in order to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we utilize adaptive learning rate to speed up the convergence speed of DBN. For the migration, we design a topology-aware greedy algorithm with the goal to optimize system cost by taking full advantage of the prediction result. In addition, based on tabu search, the proposed migration mechanism is further optimized. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a good performance in reducing system cost and improving the service level agreements (SLA) of service.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935014","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571073); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZD-M201800601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796340","Virtual network function;deep belief network;multi-task learning;migration","Dynamic scheduling;Bandwidth;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Network function virtualization","5G mobile communication;belief networks;contracts;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;search problems;virtualisation","future resource requirements;effective prediction;bandwidth utilization;resource utilization;online learning;prediction mechanism;multitask learning;prediction accuracy;adaptive learning rate;DBN;topology-aware greedy algorithm;migration mechanism;virtual network function migration;dynamic resource requirements prediction;network function virtualization;flexible deployment;5G mobile communication network;fluctuated resources;embedding VNFs;time-varying resource requirements;real-time VNF migration algorithm;deep belief network;service level agreements;tabu search","","11","","37","CCBY","13 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Towards this end, we provide in this paper a tutorial and a comprehensive survey of QoE management solutions in current and future networks. We start with a high-level description of QoE management for multimedia services, which integrates QoE modelling, monitoring, and optimization. This followed by a discussion of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) solutions as the dominant technique for streaming videos over the best-effort Internet. We then summarize the key elements in SDN/NFV along with an overview of ongoing research projects, standardization activities and use cases related to SDN, NFV, and other emerging applications. We provide a survey of the state-of-the-art of QoE management techniques categorized into three different groups: a) QoE-aware/driven strategies using SDN and/or NFV; b) QoE-aware/driven approaches for adaptive streaming over emerging architectures such as multi-access edge computing, cloud/fog computing, and information-centric networking; and c) extended QoE management approaches in new domains such as immersive augmented and virtual reality, mulsemedia and video gaming applications. Based on the review, we present a list of identified future QoE management challenges regarding emerging multimedia applications, network management and orchestration, network slicing and collaborative service management in softwarized networks. Finally, we provide a discussion on future research directions with a focus on emerging research areas in QoE management, such as QoE-oriented business models, QoE-based big data strategies, and scalability issues in QoE optimization.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2019.2958784","European Union of Horizon2020 Research and Innovation Programme through Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (MSCA-ITN-2014-ETN)(grant numbers:643072); Network QoE-NET; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930519","QoE;network management;OTT;ISP;5G;SDN;NFV;OTT and ISP collaboration","Quality of experience;Streaming media;Videos;Tutorials;Optimization;Cloud computing;Adaptation models","Big Data;cloud computing;computer network management;quality of experience;software defined networking;video streaming;virtualisation","Internet Service Providers;ISP;network resources;network function virtualization;service customization;service delivery;QoE management solutions;multimedia services;HTTP adaptive streaming;QoE management techniques;information-centric networking;network slicing;collaborative service management;softwarized networks;QoE-oriented business models;QoE-based big data strategies;QoE optimization;software defined networks;multimedia streaming services;over-the-top multimedia applications;quality of experience;NFV;SDN;intelligent QoE control;HAS solutions","","11","","407","IEEE","10 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, an example wireless application use case is presented to illustrate the benefits that blockchain technology can bring to wireless applications. A set of pending research issues addressing some of the challenges faced by blockchain-enabled wireless applications is introduced. As a potential solution, a wireless blockchain middleware architecture (BlockWare) is proposed, based on a blockchain middleware layer connecting wireless applications and underlying blockchain infrastructure. The blockchain middleware layer interacts with various types of blockchain systems on behalf of different wireless applications. Thus, a wireless application does not need to implement complex blockchain functions, rather relying on the blockchain middleware layer and its services to leverage various underlying blockchain systems.

Doppler shift severely degrades reception performance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless communication systems. The performance of the Doppler shift estimator is directly related to safety in the HST because the 5G HST system is used for train control. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fast and accurate Doppler shift estimator (DSE) with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning-based DSE (MLDSE). Taking note of the fact that an HST travels the same path repeatedly, the MLDSE estimates the Doppler shift by using the reference signal received power (RSRP) values measured by the mobile receiver at all times. However, since there is a one-to-many mapping problem when the RSRP values reflecting the 5G beam sweeping and selection correspond to Doppler shifts, machine learning cannot be performed. To solve this problem, we design an RSRP ambiguity reducer (AR) for the machine learning input so that the pattern of RSRP values can be mapped and learned into corresponding Doppler shifts. As a result, MLDSE can estimate Doppler shift more accurately than any HST DSEs known to the authors. In addition, an MLDSE consisting of only three layers is superior to the conventional techniques in terms of computational complexity as well as estimation accuracy.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3044175","R & D Program of Korea Railroad Research Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2018R1D1A1B07050143); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9292473","HST;Mobility;Railway;MLP;Deep learning","Doppler shift;Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Simulation;Estimation;Machine learning;Computational complexity","Doppler shift;learning (artificial intelligence);OFDM modulation;radio receivers;railway communication;television receivers","RSRP-based Doppler shift estimator;high-speed train systems;fifth-generation high-speed train system operating;HST;higher Doppler shift;wireless communication systems;fast Doppler shift estimator;accurate Doppler shift estimator;machine learning-based DSE;MLDSE;RSRP values;machine learning input;corresponding Doppler shifts","","1","","39","IEEE","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the devices on IoT are expected to grow exponentially in the following years, resulting a dramatic increase in bandwidth requirements. Thus, more efficient management and planning of the network's bandwidth resources are essential in the evolution of mobile systems. In this vein, we propose an Intelligent Scheme (IS) to schedule the communications in the mobile systems for enabling emerging applications, such as connected cars. In our scheme, a core component controller is added to the network, which consists of two parts: the controller database and the controller server. The resource availability status of each cell is recorded in the database. The controller server cooperates with the Intelligent Start Algorithm (ISA) on the end-user controlling the traffic of the whole network. The uploading of time-non-sensitive content is delayed if there are not enough resources at the located cell. We evaluate the performance of this Intelligent Scheme (IS) based on NS-3. The obtained results indicate that our Intelligent Scheme (IS) manages to reduce the packet loss and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for users.

Therefore, MNOs realized the need for improving the network performance for indoor environments. Small cells are being introduced as one of the solutions to improve the network capacity for local area and indoor environments. Internet of Radio Light (IoRL) is a 5G small-cell gNB base station.

In such an environment, we are particularly interested in supervising network slicing, a recent tool enabling to create multiple virtual networks for different applications and QoS constraints on a Telco infrastructure. The goal is to infer the underlay resources states from the measurements performed in the overlay structure. We model the inference task as a regression problem that we solve following a Neural Network approach. Since getting labeled data for the training phase can be costly, our procedure generates artificial data for the training phase. By creating a large set of random training examples, the Neural Network learns the relations between the measures done at path and link levels. This approach takes advantage of efficient Machine Learning solutions to solve a classic inference problem. Simulations with a public dataset show very promising results compared to statistical-based methods.

Agile scaling of the VNF chains according to real-time traffic rates is the key in network function virtualization. Designing efficient scaling algorithms is challenging, especially for geo-distributed chains, where bandwidth costs and latencies incurred by the WAN traffic are important but difficult to handle in making scaling decisions. Existing studies have largely resorted to optimization algorithms in scaling design. Aiming at better decisions empowered by in-depth learning from experiences, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for scaling of the geo-distributed VNF chains, exploring inherent pattern of traffic variation and good deployment strategies over time. We novelly combine a recurrent neural network as the traffic model for predicting upcoming flow rates and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for making chain placement decisions. We adopt the experience replay technique based on the actor-critic DRL algorithm to optimize the learning results.

Although 3GPP introduced the concept of self-organizing networks (SONs) in 4G and 5G documents to automate network management, even this progressive concept will face several challenges as it may not be sufficiently agile in coping with the immense levels of complexity, heterogeneity, and mobility in the envisioned beyond-5G integrated networks. In the presented vision, we discuss how future integrated networks can be intelligently and autonomously managed to efficiently utilize resources, reduce operational costs, and achieve the targeted Quality of Experience (QoE). We introduce the novel concept of the “self-evolving networks (SENs)” framework, which utilizes artificial intelligence, enabled by machine learning (ML) algorithms, to make future integrated networks fully automated and intelligently evolve with respect to the provision, adaptation, optimization, and management aspects of networking, communications, computation, and infrastructure nodes' mobility. To envisage the concept of SEN in future integrated networks, we use the Intelligent Vertical Heterogeneous Network (I-VHetNet) architecture as our reference.

Network slices are required to be isolated from each other in terms of service performance with traffic load fluctuations. In this article, the virtual network function (VNF) scalability issue is studied to meet the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement in the presence of nonstationary traffic, through joint VNF migration and resource scaling. A traffic parameter learning method based on change point detection and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed, to learn traffic parameters in a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) traffic model for each stationary traffic segment within a nonstationary traffic trace. Then, the time-varying VNF resource demand is predicted from the learned traffic parameters based on an fBm resource provisioning model. With the detected change points and predicted resource demands, a VNF migration problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with variable-length decision epochs, to maximize the long-term reward integrating load balancing, migration cost, and resource overloading penalty.

Because of this, important parts of the wireless spectrum become overloaded. Static spectrum allocation, which has been the norm for decades, is not suitable anymore. To maintain the high demand for spectrum and the continuous development of new wireless technologies, there is a need for an intelligent, dynamic spectrum allocation mechanism, where different network technologies collaboratively optimize the spectrum usage. New wireless network paradigms, such as Neutral Host Networks (NHNs) and private 5G, require a smart, spectrum-footprint-aware flow control algorithm to overcome the spectrum scarcity in collaborative way. This article presents a strategy, vision and flow control mechanism to implement collaboration in a Quality of Service (QoS)-driven way. The solution in this article is based on policies which may activate depending on its current and neighbor's network states. Through a flow ordering and selection strategy, these policies optimize the spectrum footprint, based on the performance and QoS-requirements of the own and surrounding networks. The proposed algorithm is tested extensively and validated on a large scale during the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) competition. The results of the SC2 final event and intermediate scrimmages showed that the proposed approach increased the score, indicating increased inter-network collaboration was achieved.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3031078","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) and the Flemish Government(grant numbers:1S52917N,1SB0719N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223708","Quality of service;wireless flow control;wireless networks and cellular networks;wireless spectrum collaboration","Collaboration;Quality of service;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless networks;5G mobile communication;Optimization","optimisation;quality of service;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control","new wireless network paradigms;smart spectrum-footprint-aware flow control algorithm;spectrum scarcity;flow control mechanism;selection strategy;spectrum footprint;QoS-requirements;Quality of Service-driven way;inter-network collaboration;spectrum usage;dynamic spectrum allocation mechanism;intelligent spectrum allocation mechanism;wireless technologies;static spectrum allocation;wireless spectrum;wireless network technologies;collaborative flow control;DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge competition","","","","33","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model results shed light on the problems resulting from the application of evolved standard access procedures and help understand how many devices can be served per base station with specified latency targets. In addition, considering the simultaneous presence of different traffic classes, we investigate the effectiveness of prioritised access, exploiting access class barring techniques. Our model shows that, even with the sub-millisecond time slots foreseen in LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, a base station can accommodate at most few thousand devices to guarantee access latency below 100 ms with high transmission success probability. Lower access latency, of the order of 10 ms, can be achieved only with base stations serving an unrealistically small numbers of devices.

Modern networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, become more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation networks, such as 5G and beyond.

Caching the content closer to the end users is one solution to cope with these demands, but when service providers share a common physical infrastructure, managing the limited cache resources becomes more challenging. With this increased complexity, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents itself as an optimal solution. In this work, we propose a dynamic DRL-based management framework for virtual cache slicing and customized content placement. The virtualization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and it utilizes a deep Q-network to autonomously make network-wide slicing decisions and optimize the cache resource allocation. These global decisions are then mapped to the small cell stations with a dynamic resource provisioning algorithm. Lastly, a customized content placement algorithm is used to find the optimal content placement policy for each service provider. The content placement problem is first formulated as a convex optimization problem and is then solved with a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, the simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923021","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771098); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J068); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2017GFW0128,8ZDYF2268,2018JY0578,2017JY0007); ZTE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736820","Content placement;deep reinforcement learning;deep Q-networks;network virtualization;resource provisioning;resource slicing","Resource management;Quality of service;Virtualization;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Complexity theory","cache storage;convex programming;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile radio;quality of service;resource allocation;virtualisation","virtualized mobile edge network;mobile traffic;end users;service provider;common physical infrastructure;deep reinforcement learning;dynamic DRL-based management framework;virtual cache slicing;virtualization problem;Markov decision process;deep Q-network;network-wide slicing decisions;cache resource allocation;global decisions;dynamic resource provisioning algorithm;customized content placement algorithm;optimal content placement policy;content placement problem;convex optimization problem;distributed alternating direction method of multipliers;autonomous cache resource slicing;quality of service","","4","","28","OAPA","14 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many emerging services such as smart city, Industry 4.0, and autonomous driving are based on IoT devices and applications to collect and analyze data and control end devices (i.e., actuators). Among these services, several IoT applications, such as data analytics, need to be deployed at the edge to either reduce the latency to access data or treat the high amount of generated data locally. However, in the context of LoRa/LoRaWAN, most of the current IoT service deployments run the applications at a central cloud to ease the integration with existing software as a service (SaaS) platforms, without exploiting the benefits of edge computing. In this article, we propose a new framework that leverages the ETSI multi-access edge computing (MEC) model to deploy LoRabased IoT applications at the edge. In particular, the proposed model takes advantage of the ETSI MEC features, such as dynamic deployment of an IoT application at the edge and application life cycle management. In addition, the proposed framework allows running an IoT application as a 5G network slice at the edge.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.1900051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139047","","Internet of Things;Logic gates;Servers;Edge computing;Network servers;Computer architecture;Cloud computing","cloud computing;Internet of Things;wide area networks","low-power wide area network technologies;narrowband IoT;emerging services;control end devices;data analytics;access data;IoT service deployments;ETSI multiaccess edge computing model;LoRabased IoT applications;ETSI MEC features;dynamic deployment;application life cycle management;LoRaWAN","","1","","13","","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, as V2X services become more mission-critical, new solutions need to be devised to guarantee their successful service delivery even in exceptional situations, e.g. road accidents, congestion, etc. In this context, we propose π-ROAD, a deep learning framework to automatically learn regular mobile traffic patterns along roads, detect non-recurring events and classify them by severity level. π-ROAD enables operators to proactively instantiate dedicated Emergency Network Slices (ENS) as needed while re-dimensioning the existing slices according to their service criticality level. Our framework is validated by means of real mobile network traces collected within 400 km of a highway in Europe and augmented with publicly available information on related road events.

Toward this vision, we focus on the challenges pertaining to managing access to shared spectrum [e.g., 3.5-GHz U.S. Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum]. We propose Iris, a practical shared spectrum access architecture for indoor neutral-host small-cells. At the core of Iris is a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic pricing mechanism that efficiently mediates access to shared spectrum for diverse operators in a way that provides incentives for operators and the neutral-host alike. We then present the Iris system architecture that embeds this dynamic pricing mechanism alongside cloud-RAN and RAN slicing design principles in a practical neutral-host design tailored for the indoor small-cell environment. Using a prototype implementation of the Iris system, we present the extensive experimental evaluation results that not only offer insight into the Iris dynamic pricing process and its superiority over alternative approaches but also demonstrate its deployment feasibility.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2927067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756106","Indoor mobile access;small cells;neutral host;RAN slicing;C-RAN;shared spectrum;dynamic pricing;deep reinforcement learning","Pricing;Iris recognition;Reinforcement learning;Prototypes;Informatics;Quality of experience;Broadband communication","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;radio spectrum management","indoor small-cell environment;deep reinforcement learning driven shared spectrum access architecture;indoor neutral-host small cells;indoor mobile access;small-cell infrastructure;dynamic sharing;indoor small-cell deployments;mobile operator ecosystem;deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic pricing mechanism;Iris system architecture","","4","","84","IEEE","5 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach has not considered the scenarios where different slices require different PHY and MAC layers, for instance, for radically different services and for whole-stack research in wireless living labs where novel PHY and MAC layers need to be deployed concurrently with existing ones on the same physical infrastructure. To enable whole-stack slicing where different PHY and MAC layers may be deployed in different slices, we develop PV-RAN, the first open-source virtual RAN platform that enables the sharing of the same SDR physical resources across multiple slices. Through API Remoting, PV-RAN enables running paravirtualized instances of OpenAirInterface (OAI) at different slices without requiring modifying OAI source code. PV-RAN effectively leverages the inter-domain communication mechanisms of Xen to transport time-sensitive I/Q samples via shared memory, making the virtualization overhead in communication almost negligible. We conduct detailed performance benchmarking of PV-RAN and demonstrate its low overhead and high efficiency.

So far, two related widely adopted solutions are software defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). There is one main difference between these two new networking paradigms. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane through a well-defined programming interface, such that the centralized controller can have a complete view of the entire network, while NFV decouples network functions from dedicated physical equipment by means of virtualization technology, and runs the virtual network functions (VNFs) in the general purpose physical or virtual network appliances. Both approaches make the network programmable in order to have the aforementioned desired features. SDN and NFV do not depend on each other, and they actually complement each other. They can work well individually and can also work in tandem for performance reasons. Due to such advantages, both SDN and NFV have become key enabling technologies for 5G networks, and have also been used in a wide range of important areas including IoT, mobile edge computing, smart grid, cloud datacenters, and cognition-based networks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2959197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9007061","","Special issues and sections;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Network slicing;Machine learning;Software radio;Network function virtualization","","","","","","0","IEEE","21 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, the evolution towards learning-based data driven networks is still in its infancy, and much of the realization of the promised benefits requires thorough research and development. Fundamental questions remain as to where and how ML can really complement the well-established, well-tested communication systems designed over the last four decades. Moreover, adaptation of machine learning methods is likely needed to realize their full potential in the wireless context. This is particularly challenging for the lower layers of the protocol stack, where the constraints, problem formulation, and even the objectives may fundamentally differ from the typical scenarios to which machine learning has been successfully applied in recent years. In addition, a thorough understanding of the fundamental performance limits is also essential in order to establish quality-of-service guarantees that are common in communication system design. Such challenges, which lie at the core of the special issue, can be categorized into a number of research topics ranging from the optization of neural networks architectures that are suited to wireless communication links (inclusing autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement based networks etc) to performance analysis, to the acceleration of data-driven training, and possibly in distributed settings.

Although technologies such as direct link, WiFi, and satellite communications are still useful in some remote scenarios where cellular services are unavailable, it is believed that exploiting the thriving 5G and beyond cellular networks to support UAV communications is the most promising and cost-effective approach, especially when the number of UAVs grows dramatically. On the one hand, to guarantee safe and efficient flight operations of multiple UAVs, it is of paramount importance to provide secure and ultra-reliable communication links between the UAVs and their ground pilots or control stations for conveying command and control signals, especially in beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) scenarios. On the other hand, because of advances in communication equipment miniaturization as well as UAV manufacturing, mounting compact and lightweight base stations (BSs) or relays on UAVs becomes increasingly feasible. This has led to two promising research paradigms for UAV communications, namely, UAV-assisted cellular communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into cellular networks as aerial communication platforms and aerial users, respectively. As such, integrating UAVs into cellular networks is believed to be a win-win technology for both UAV-related industries and cellular network operators, which not only creates plenty of new business opportunities but also benefits the communication performance of 3-D wireless networks. In addition, UAV related sensing and computing are also helpful for achieving efficient and reliable communication (e.g., in avoiding coverage holes) as well as smart UAV coordination, positioning, and trajectory design. However, 5G and beyond wireless networks with UAVs significantly differs from traditional communication systems, because of the high altitude and high maneuverability of UAVs, the unique UAV-ground channels, the diversified quality of service (QoS) requirements for downlink command and control (C&C) and uplink mission-related data transmission, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the new design degrees of freedom enabled by joint UAV mobility control and communication resource allocation.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3090875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538498","","","","","","","","0","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tremendous research and development efforts have already been emphasized on the enabling technologies toward next generation wireless systems to support a variety of critical and personalized services in multiple application domains, including industry use cases, environment, transportation, education, public health and safety, and defense. Wireless communication networks have been greatly advanced by exploiting technologies such as millimeter wave, dynamic spectrum sharing, massive MIMO, beam forming, network slicing and virtualization, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technology breakthroughs can empower wireless networks to support extreme high capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-low latency communications for new use cases identified for next generation wireless systems. In order to design and deploy wireless communication systems with IoT devices across heterogeneous and dynamic environments to provide next generation wireless services, however, there are many critical technical challenges yet to be addressed. In this issue of IEEE Wireless Communications, we are pleased to present two feature topics to bring together researchers, industry practitioners, and individuals working on the related areas to address some of these technical challenges for IoT and next generation wireless systems. One feature topic on “Massive Machine-Type Communications for IoT” includes four articles, and was organized by guest editors W. Ji, T. Ebrahimi, Z. Li, J. Yuan, D. O. Wu, and Y.

The 5G network is built on a service-based architecture (SBA) which enables programmability of the control plane of 5G Core (5GC) and supports network slicing (NS) in both core and access networks. NS enables the creation of multiple, isolated network slices tailored for specific services with diverse KPI objectives [1]. SBA of 5GC facilitates core network user plane functions (UPF) being deployed near the network edge, which has triggered intense interest in edge activities such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), whereas the traditional Self-Organizing Network (SON) functions are being enhanced continuously in 5G RAN. Meanwhile, the development of open and smart RAN led by an industry alliance, O-RAN, has received great attention. In this short paper we would like to sort out if and how all of the above would fit together in a consistent and efficient manner regarding their architecture aspects and functionalities.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2020.9277891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277891","","5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Self-organizing networks;Information technology;Network slicing;Edge computing;Radio access networks","","","","","","8","","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The continuous evolution of network technology and the digitization of the economy are key drivers for defining the expected 6G networks. Academia and industry have made tremendous strides during the past few years to shift the networking paradigm from human-centric communication to machine-type communication, and those gains will eventually lead to everything-type communication. Such developments have already enabled 5G systems to support massive connectivity, multigigabit data rates, massive multipleinput/ multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication, nonorthogonal multiple access, multiuser access, edge computing, dense wavelength division multiplexing for transport networks, service-based architectures, network slicing, network function virtualization, network automation, and core network encryption. Moreover, service requests are now processed using various sets of performance metrics in intelligent and self-healing fashions. Scaling these types of automated networks requires paradigm changes in communication network management, where communication and computation must ultimately fuse. Overall, this will lead to orders of magnitude of improved user satisfaction, and it eventually will spin out new, smaller domains for local and efficient service provisioning (e.g., private networks).
